EP will enhance the cross-functionality and bridge the gap between pure science and traditional engineering disciplines which conventionally are pursued independently. This is necessary because in today\u2019s world major scientific and technological breakthroughs happen in a multi-disciplinary environment where scientists from pure science work along with engineers. It is, therefore, highly important to inculcate both scientific and technological aspects, and the EP program will serve this purpose.\n[03/06/25, 8:49:19\u202fPM] Himank Arora: You take a bus at night, reach Mandi the next morning\n[03/06/25, 8:49:21\u202fPM] Vidisha Thokal: You can easily get buses tbh",

This branch is ideal for students who are undecided about their career path and wish to explore various engineering domains before making a choice. In the first two years, the program promotes interdisciplinary learning, allowing students to delve into mechanical topics (mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics), electrical topics (semiconductor electronics, digital systems, signal processing), and software fields (data science, machine learning, deep learning).\nStudents graduate with a B.Tech in General Engineering with Specialisation in [ABC], where ABC refers to one of the available specialisations: Robotics & AI, Mechatronics, Finance Management, or Communications. These begin in the third year and include focused coursework in the chosen area.",
