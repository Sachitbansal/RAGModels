[29/05/25, 1:40:38 AM] ~ Srishti: Hello, regards, acc to last year ranks I'm getting iit mandi generally engineer, also iit bhu metallurgy, please guide
[29/05/25, 1:41:26 AM] Pourush Sharma: Take BHU
[29/05/25, 1:42:06 AM] Vitthal Seth: Not a straightforward answer in my opinion!
[29/05/25, 1:42:15 AM] ~ Srishti: What exactly is covered in general engineering...?
[29/05/25, 1:42:25 AM] Pourush Sharma: Share your opinion too :)
[29/05/25, 1:43:27 AM] Pourush Sharma: 2 years of general courses across all branches,
2 years of specialisations in some particular fields
[29/05/25, 1:43:50 AM] Vitthal Seth: There are courses from multiple branches for you to take till your 4th sem and then you can choose your specialisation , there 4 at this moment and 
There will be an official communication of brochure shortly!
[29/05/25, 1:45:45 AM] Vitthal Seth: There are many seniors in this group who you can personally talk to regarding any doubts!
General Engineering’28 CR- @919049536185 
And @919501006994
[29/05/25, 1:47:25 AM] ~ Srishti: Thank you so much, so in third year we can choose our specialisations, are the options like cse types or...?
[29/05/25, 1:47:26 AM] Vitthal Seth: But yeah wait for the official release of brochure, everything would get crystal clear by it!
[29/05/25, 1:47:54 AM] Pourush Sharma: Nope, theres stuff like robotics, finance, etc. afaik
[29/05/25, 1:48:38 AM] Vitthal Seth: Not as in branch wise , more localised specialisations , industry specific! Robotics and finance etc !
[29/05/25, 1:50:21 AM] ~ Srishti: Okay, thank you!
[29/05/25, 1:52:28 AM] Pourush Sharma: in my opinion (iit mandi academic secretary):
when thinking about GE, understand that for specialisation you’ll have to compete, since they’d be based on your cgpa. Moreover, from an employer’s pov, why would i choose someone with 2 years studying the branch over someone studying 3? also understand that core jobs in robotics etc would require a masters, so make sure you’re committed to the specialization you get if you dont want go into stuff like software
[29/05/25, 1:53:33 AM] Pourush Sharma: i was in the room where this branch was created, and i’ll recommend you choose bhu for now. maybe in a few years, we’ll know better how GE would look like in terms of careers
[29/05/25, 1:53:59 AM] Vitthal Seth: i think you are not informed adequately because there is no criteria of CGPA for choosing any specialisation .
[29/05/25, 1:54:35 AM] ~ Srishti: Exactly I was thinking the same point coz how would the placements be like...and do ppl generally do coding and stuff...
[29/05/25, 1:54:36 AM] Pourush Sharma: how are the specialisations offered thenv
[29/05/25, 1:54:39 AM] Pourush Sharma: *?
[29/05/25, 1:54:39 AM] Vitthal Seth: I suggest @919340853130 please wait for the official communication by our CR @919049536185
[29/05/25, 1:54:56 AM] Vitthal Seth: They are free to choose for all !
[29/05/25, 1:55:11 AM] Pourush Sharma: Oh
[29/05/25, 1:55:32 AM] ~ Srishti: Sure thank you...
[29/05/25, 1:55:51 AM] Pourush Sharma: I’ll just say this and drop in that case: the admin says they’re open. 1 year of working with them and i can say safely to not rely on this for your future
[29/05/25, 1:56:23 AM] Pourush Sharma: If a particular dept rejects beyond a certain no. Of specialisation students, then you *will* be forced to take a diff specialisn
[29/05/25, 1:56:24 AM] Vitthal Seth: @919818337899 please refrain from creating any confusion about this branch since it is relatively new ,people already have their doubts !
[29/05/25, 1:57:08 AM] Pourush Sharma: exactly what im saying, its new and you dont know how itll work
[29/05/25, 1:57:12 AM] Pourush Sharma: Let them decide
[29/05/25, 1:57:28 AM] Pourush Sharma: The people who designed the branch have left
[29/05/25, 1:58:11 AM] Pourush Sharma: baaki cool, what i said was from one year of working with the admin, if someone wants to go for it then sure
[29/05/25, 1:58:56 AM] Pourush Sharma: gist of the matter is that a 1st yearite from ge says you should take it,
a 3rd yearite student representative says u should take bhu
[29/05/25, 1:58:59 AM] Pourush Sharma: Make ur call
[29/05/25, 1:59:20 AM] Vitthal Seth: But people are still pursuing it and striving to make it better ! There is no need for this much pessimism!
[29/05/25, 1:59:43 AM] Pourush Sharma: Duly acknowledged!♥️
[29/05/25, 1:59:56 AM] Pourush Sharma: I’m one of those people btw

[29/05/25, 11:52:34 AM] ~ Prabhav Vaishnav: Why not delhi?
[29/05/25, 11:53:58 AM] Saksham setia: Branch also matters as it will be the basis of what you will be studying for 3 years
[29/05/25, 11:54:16 AM] Ujjwal Singh: Like if you are interested in semiconductor and stuff then only go for vlsi otherwise choose ee as it will give you more options in future if you want to pursue higher education.
[29/05/25, 11:54:32 AM] Sachit Bansal: Then its more on ki tum iits compare kr re ho keeping ki mind ki branch achhi hai ki ni. Delhi mein tumhe lower most branch milri hai jiski long term mein demand nahi hai. 
IIT Mandi is the first IIT to have vlsi btech and uski companies bhi achhii aati hain because mtech hai. And long yerm mein vlsi ki bohot demand hai in silicon insdustry in both india and abroad
[29/05/25, 11:55:09 AM] ~ Prabhav Vaishnav: Long term growth is based on college or branch?
[29/05/25, 11:56:50 AM] Saksham setia: Mostly branch as it will lead to main carrier paths you are going to be in future

College will lead to networking but what you are going to pursue will be mostly dependent on your branch
[29/05/25, 11:57:36 AM] ~ Prabhav Vaishnav: Seniors at IITD group are saying that Textile leaves lot of time for self learning and is an easier branch for cgpa farming?
[29/05/25, 11:58:09 AM] Sachit Bansal: This does not have a straight forward and direct answer. Theee are lot of factor to account for in this. Ki bande ka interest kya hai and use kis field mein jana hai. And collehe mein interests bhi bohot change hote hain within first year. Based onhow nuch you explore
[29/05/25, 11:59:43 AM] Sachit Bansal: Cgpa is not more than 30% of college thing according to me. You only need it to sit in placements. Ig that all. 
Simple example
IITR mein ek banda with 5.4 gpa secured a package of 2cr off campus. Lekin campus placements mein highest was around 60 lakh
[29/05/25, 12:00:00 PM] Sachit Bansal: Iss saal ki hi baat hai ye

[29/05/25, 12:00:44 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: Ropar mein plus point ye hai ki branch change abhi discontinue nahi hui hai...
[29/05/25, 12:01:05 PM] Rishi Atreya: So if you choose lower branches in a good IIT, you are allowed to gain knowledge by yourself for whichever higher branch you want such as CSE, but you when you sit for placement you will be amongst actual cse students giving you less chances there
In a 2nd gen IIT, you can choose electrical if you want to have a broad spectrum for choices, or you can choose VLSI which limits your field of study but is a good specialisation with nicer scope for placement
Keep this in mind while making your choice ‎<This message was edited>

[29/05/25, 8:31:46 PM] Dushyant: @919210056775 dont compare directly
Pehle sare iit's website pe jake dekho ki which courses offer what in terms of industrial training and what alligns to your interest
Basically cousre structure study karo you might find something unexpected in different branches across iit's
[29/05/25, 8:34:37 PM] Dushyant: And also dont mindlessly go behind cse because it offers high pakage(trust me you might like it or not like it depending on the institution you choose)

[30/05/25, 7:33:22 PM] Akshat Mittal: Yes, i think mandi cse is totally worth it, at mandi, cse department is growing well.  Bhu mnc and roorkee electrical are also good option but it depends on what you like and what you want to do in future
[30/05/25, 7:35:31 PM] ~ Ayush Rajoria'25: I want to go in tech side only not interested in core but are opportunities in mandi at par with other iits or there are some drawbacks with respect to opportunities??
[30/05/25, 7:36:06 PM] Piyush Roy: I strongly believe that Bhu mnc is better than iit mandi cse, check their syllabus and placement stats of MNC
[30/05/25, 7:36:38 PM] ~ Ayush Rajoria'25: Okay thank you
[30/05/25, 8:11:21 PM] Arihant Jain: MnC does have a lot more maths focus than CSE which can be burdensome for a lot of people and hinder their skill development other than academics tho

[02/06/25, 12:13:13 PM] Sachit Bansal: Ill get it added in the document 👍
[02/06/25, 12:14:42 PM] Sachit Bansal: If you prefer iit over branch without any questions asked. Then you can go for IITR BsMs. Or IITKGP or BHU lower branches
[02/06/25, 12:15:13 PM] ~ Tk Jain 1: My son got 1317 rank in advance plz guide for good iit and good course
[02/06/25, 12:16:25 PM] Sachit Bansal: If you require a decent branch then you can lookup IIT Mandi or IIT Ropar
[02/06/25, 12:16:52 PM] Sachit Bansal: In mandi you can lookup for EP or General Engineering. In Ropar you can see MSE
[02/06/25, 12:17:10 PM] ~ ...: Is MSE good?
[02/06/25, 12:17:42 PM] Sachit Bansal: Its more on interest. If you like it. Its good

[02/06/25, 12:19:24 PM] Sachit Bansal: Then you can tey for IIT Mandi EP

[02/06/25, 12:20:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Branch change not in IIT Mandi
[02/06/25, 12:20:35 PM] ~ Prakashba Vala: Okay
[02/06/25, 12:21:04 PM] ~ Prakashba Vala: And even in other tier 2 iits would that option be valid for this year
[02/06/25, 12:21:05 PM] ~ Prakashba Vala: ?
[02/06/25, 12:21:10 PM] Sachit Bansal: Do look for course structure before making your mind. Many people just see physics and get attracted to EP. Look for structure and future prospects as well. If it resonates with your mind only then go for it
[02/06/25, 12:21:11 PM] Priyansh Saha: what subject is he interested in? any branch has value if the student has interest

although, at his rank it would probably be better for you to look into older iits, unless he really wants to experience mountain college life 😂
[02/06/25, 12:21:30 PM] Sachit Bansal: And CSE branch
[02/06/25, 12:21:43 PM] Vidhi Chandak: You can check the official website of josaa for updates on branch change . For now , I think it is the same as previous year
[02/06/25, 12:21:51 PM] Sachit Bansal: Um. Look on website
[02/06/25, 12:25:03 PM] Dushyant: Look as i am in ep the course structure depends on different iits and what they offer 
TBH iit mandi ep is very flexible and offers excellent range of courses and iit mandi ep os more focused on quantum physics and field theory so see accordingly

[02/06/25, 12:36:53 PM] Arjun Mohan Saxena: yes , the branch can provide you with the specialization in semiconductor , material informatics ( that is artificial intelligence in material Science) and product design. It being one of the chill branches the curriculum is not hectic giving you time to pursue your interest in other fields too. 
If you want to get into core semiconductors is one of the well paying industries right now and there is demand of material scientists in companies even like mercedes f1 to research on material requirements of the cars , tech companies for hardware and space oriented companies like nasa. ( you get the picture).

ECE is, at a glance, more practical.

Both are tough, both involve a lot of scary maths

[02/06/25, 1:20:29 PM] Dushyant: Ep core is more into physics and basics of engineering, you get to learn physics and with that whatever you have interests on like maybe cs or maybe micro controlers and all. Atleast this is how it is in iit mandi i haven't seen other iits core structurs in this. Basically you get to learn physics but other courses as well 

Idk abt chemical their cr will tell more 
And mech @919008911915 will tell

[02/06/25, 1:21:32 PM] Vidisha Thokal: The branch BS in chemical sciences is very much into research
In the first year you'll be learning the same  subjects as everyone but from the second year the whole syllabus will be chemistry based with Free electives which you can choose according to your own interest(which decides your minor in degree)
Also in your last year as per the curriculum of IIT Mandi you get research projects,each in 7th and 8th sem
If you're really interested in chemistry you can consider this as your option ‎<This message was edited>

[02/06/25, 1:25:38 PM] Saksham setia: Microelectronics is a specialisation in ECE with main focus on chip designing. Ig IIT Mandi is the only IIT with this branch in Btech.

Although it's a new branch with no placement records in btech, it has an Mtech here so we have connections with companies for placements

[02/06/25, 1:27:09 PM] Chinmay Gupta: I would recommend Dhanbad ECE
VLSI is a niche branch
ECE offers Outlooks into more domains and Dhanbad is an older and better established college than Mandi

It also allows for you to get your M.Tech in one year or a minor in any other field along with your major in bioengineering if you complete a certain amount of courses of the said field(if you’re interested). Go through the course structure once before deciding, but definitely IIT Mandi if you ask me.

3. 1 saal mein MS bhi kr skte ho.
And jo buri cheez hai wo ye hi hai ki proff chayenge tum research mein hi focus raho!!!

[02/06/25, 4:19:58 PM] Arihant Jain: at 2k rank i had choice between ropar all vs mandi all

Any data ?
[02/06/25, 6:07:08 PM] Dushyant: Closest airport is far
[02/06/25, 6:07:15 PM] ~ Ayush Singh: Just to add a little on Wi-Fi, although it works most of the time, due to some reason it keeps disconnecting every time (30 mins if your luck is bad, a couple hours if it's good and for some reason also works marvellously well with Linux)

And say you move from place A to place B, you'd need to log in to the WiFi again.
[02/06/25, 6:07:25 PM] ~ Ayush Singh: New branch, no data available

[02/06/25, 6:08:10 PM] Dushyant: You have to take bus  from chandigarh to mandi
[02/06/25, 6:08:12 PM] ~ Prince: Should I go for it??
[02/06/25, 6:08:38 PM] Rishi Atreya: And for mobile network, Jio and Airtel alone are preferred
[02/06/25, 6:08:43 PM] Dushyant: Dw the bus you will come in will be of manali rout which are quite luxurious
[02/06/25, 6:08:53 PM] ~ .: Kulu , shimla se kitti dur ?
[02/06/25, 6:09:04 PM] Rishi Atreya: Closest airport is chandigarh
Which is 4-5 hours away from the institute
[02/06/25, 6:09:07 PM] ~ .: Achaa..
[02/06/25, 6:09:08 PM] Dushyant: Kulu se 1hr shimla is ig 6hrs
[02/06/25, 6:09:11 PM] Vidisha Thokal: The closest airport is kullu but people don't prefer that as it's very costly so it's either by chandigarh or delhi
And you can easily get buses from Delhi or chandigarh so it's pretty easy to reach mandi and from mandi there are campus buses also you can  book a cab ‎<This message was edited>
[02/06/25, 6:09:26 PM] ~ Ayush Singh: Closest airport : Bhuntar (Kullu) Airport, but is meaningfully not useful. Not many flights and the ones that are actually flying out are really expensive, so practically it's Chandigarh (~4.5hrs away)

No railway either, you'll HAVE to take the road route (cab/bus) at least from Chandigarh
[02/06/25, 6:09:52 PM] ~ .: Are the cabs kinda expensive ?
[02/06/25, 6:10:24 PM] Dushyant: Your choice if you want management jobs and also if you want an good mba degree directly
[02/06/25, 6:10:33 PM] ~ Ayush Singh: I'll give you a reference: 4.5k for  5 seater cab (including driver) from campus to Chandigarh airport
[02/06/25, 6:10:37 PM] Dushyant: Yes but you can always cab pol
[02/06/25, 6:11:03 PM] ~ Ayush Singh: That'd require much more context to answer, buddy
[02/06/25, 6:11:05 PM] ~ .: Kya matlab cab flight se hi mehengi pad gayi
[02/06/25, 6:11:22 PM] Dushyant: So bus is a good option
[02/06/25, 6:11:23 PM] ~ .: Thanks a lot tho guys for clearing my doubts 😊😊
[02/06/25, 6:11:33 PM] ~ Ayush Singh: No Chandigarh flights would be more expensive LOL

And you'll pool obviously
[02/06/25, 6:11:43 PM] Vidisha Thokal: Chandigarh se flight jyada mehngi hoti hai
[02/06/25, 6:11:58 PM] Rishi Atreya: Bus is a better option
If you want to book a cab, cab pooling helps a lot

[02/06/25, 6:21:39 PM] Sachit Bansal: @918815142268 @918770747456 
Please guide @919990869404 about imba. He is getting mech and chem in nit. He wants to know about imba
[02/06/25, 6:22:05 PM] Sachit Bansal: @916280996694 @918076282838
[02/06/25, 6:23:23 PM] Sachit Bansal: Vlsi is more focused on designing ic circuits as the name suggests. Ece is more communication and hard core electronics like digital and analog electronics
[02/06/25, 6:24:19 PM] ~ .: Doesnt  vlsi and microelectronics come under the ece curriculum
[02/06/25, 6:25:27 PM] Dushyant: Ig not because ece curriculum doesn't include chip manufacturing and ic circuit design
[02/06/25, 6:25:33 PM] Sachit Bansal: Yes it comes under. Vlsi is more specialised kinda like expanding a branch of ece
[02/06/25, 6:26:13 PM] Sachit Bansal: In broad way. Vlsi is a part only. Maybe a small part. But yea you get the ideaa
[02/06/25, 6:26:47 PM] ~ Ramneet: ‎~ krsna added ~ Ramneet. Tap to change who can add other members.
[02/06/25, 6:26:55 PM] Sachit Bansal: Considering IIT Mandi, we have Mtech in vlsi since long. So the placement cells already have good  company network for placements and info sessions as well
[02/06/25, 6:27:33 PM] Sachit Bansal: And within iit mandi, according to last year, vlsi cutoff went above ee. So ig you see people are prioritising vlsi. @916280996694 can elaborate on my views
[02/06/25, 6:28:01 PM] ~ vivekjangir1116x: Seniors, how are the opportunities for the branches after mech like ik saari companies open to all nhi rahegi.
Also in reality how hard is it to get off campus placements like does it solely depends on your coding skills or your networking?
[02/06/25, 6:28:50 PM] ~ .: Got it got it thanks
[02/06/25, 6:29:28 PM] Priyansh Saha: i mean off campus placements are completely dependent on the person right? i don’t see how college plays a role here (other than tag i guess)
[02/06/25, 6:30:00 PM] Priyansh Saha: but you’ll definitely need communicative and networking skills, along with relevant skillset for that
[02/06/25, 6:30:06 PM] Sachit Bansal: Dsa skills, then yeah. Coding, projects, skills, networking
[02/06/25, 6:30:55 PM] Sachit Bansal: In simpler terms. Off campus meim mehnat hai because you need to reachout to companies. 
On campus is convinient as companies come to you

[02/06/25, 6:35:03 PM] ~ vivekjangir1116x: It means only skills and network is needed, even if you are compromising your branch for a better iit?
[02/06/25, 6:35:26 PM] Vidhi Chandak: And also , IMBA is in Data science and AI . You can consider it if you have your interest in these fields .

and on off campus placements you aren’t supported by your college.
[02/06/25, 6:36:50 PM] Sachit Bansal: Kitna sharing hota hai bhaiya??
[02/06/25, 6:36:58 PM] Dushyant: 4 beta

[02/06/25, 6:37:21 PM] Priyansh Saha: believe me, it’s way easier to study relevant stuff than study something harder like civil and try to grind cse related stuff

[02/06/25, 6:40:48 PM] ~ vivekjangir1116x: Yaa agreed, either way only few of them are satisfied with their placements from clg support.

Each club organize their club-specific events and the participation is generally pretty good.

The coursework for this branch isn't too hectic, so you'll have ample time to develop your skillset and explore other interests.

Like it is 8th in the overall research and innovation sector and have decent placements. ‎<This message was edited>

[03/06/25, 1:04:40 PM] Chinmay Gupta: I would recommend BHU
IIT's in general have better exposure and offer better opportunities to students
BHU is also one of the oldest colleges in the country with a very strong alumni network

[03/06/25, 1:06:14 PM] Chinmay Gupta: Yeah then you should definitely consider that option

I am saying is based on experience rather than placements rank a course on its curriculum even good courses have bad placements and placements are completely depended on person to person rather than going into somthing you dont like pr know just for placements
Watch out in for curriculum for what you want to do placements to lag jayenge

[03/06/25, 1:51:44 PM] Aryan Garg: 1st year sbke courses almost same rehte hai toh 1st year you all have much time no matter the branch
After that Electrical goes on a bit busy scheduled study
And it may mean lesser time for extra skills, you will still have time but not as much as other branches might have. 
Also there are almost total 4 month of vacation summer and winter. So no matter what branch if you have interest toh time nikal hi loge

[03/06/25, 2:52:00 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Yaar ee toh nahi milega tum mech,general engineering,material ,bio dhek sakte ho
[03/06/25, 2:52:10 PM] Dushyant: Itne rank pe EP mil jayega, bht chill branch hai
[03/06/25, 2:52:19 PM] Dushyant: Minors in cs ka sakte ho
[03/06/25, 2:52:25 PM] Dushyant: Ya fir genral engineering

[03/06/25, 2:53:24 PM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: I'm thinking of going into mandi eee (my rank is ~6k and this is probably the best I can get, 6909 was the closing rank last year) but I've heard it's one of the hardest engineering major of them all.

I'm also still unsure of exactly what I want to do with my life and career, I'm curious to see if you guys think an EE degree was worth the trouble, how you found what you wanted to do, and any tips in getting through it. What's a good GPA to aim for that would allow me to still somewhat enjoy my life without compromising my job prospects? If it's also not too personal, what does pay typically look like initially, if you do know, and any info about internships would be appreciated too ...
[03/06/25, 2:53:36 PM] ~ Rajat: Ok
[03/06/25, 2:53:50 PM] ~ Rajat: Maine placement dekha is saal ka
[03/06/25, 2:54:11 PM] ~ Rajat: Usse bdia toh m nit mei cs wgera lelu?
[03/06/25, 2:54:42 PM] ~ Rajat: Coz I have not so much concerns ē iit tag
[03/06/25, 2:58:47 PM] ~ Amal-25: ‎~ Amal-25 left
[03/06/25, 2:54:49 PM] Dushyant: Cse karna hai toh nit cs is a viable option
[03/06/25, 2:55:09 PM] Dushyant: But sirf placements ke piche mat jao
[03/06/25, 2:55:24 PM] Dushyant: Trust me placements har saal change hote depending on market
[03/06/25, 2:55:31 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: yes bro, It is hardest Major of them all but it provides you opportunity to either go in Software side or Core-Electrical and Electronics.. and as in 1st year we have majority of common subjects..so CG k liye mehnat toh krni pdegi.. saari branches k saath competition hoga ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 2:56:04 PM] ~ Rajat: Han
[03/06/25, 2:56:22 PM] ~ Rajat: Aap bhi ep se ho?
[03/06/25, 2:56:29 PM] Dushyant: Yup
[03/06/25, 2:56:33 PM] Ujjwal Singh: See most of the people in this group are of second year so paywise and what all trouble it gave us can't be answered by us coz in first year everyone have almost all same courses.
Good cgpa told by most seniors is 8.5 and above at this all companies are open for you.
Definitely ee is one of the most tough but the good thing is almost all cse companies would be open for you and you have one of the best core branch as future is of digitalization and electrical will be a very important part of it
[03/06/25, 2:57:11 PM] Ujjwal Singh: So you can go for it 👍🏻
[03/06/25, 2:57:56 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: First year is your year to explore from clubs and Courses.. you will get to know where you stand and what you can do.. That's the only way you will get to know where you have potential.. exploring..
[03/06/25, 2:58:16 PM] ~ Rajat: Aapne kya soch k lia tha ep, like iit tag or u had intrest in research
[03/06/25, 2:58:36 PM] Dushyant: More interested in research
[03/06/25, 2:58:41 PM] Dushyant: Isiliye mandi aya
[03/06/25, 2:58:53 PM] Dushyant: Else dhanbad bhi tha options me
[03/06/25, 2:59:09 PM] ~ Shrestha Kumar: Also iit mandi electrical is one of the best of the core you can get at this rank and also if you have interest in electrical go for it, you will get to know through the process how to counter the difficulty. ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 2:59:39 PM] Dushyant: Plus EP offers double majors in physics or any field of choice so it reduces your burden for masters
[03/06/25, 3:00:35 PM] ~ Rajat: But my major priority r placement n campus , so should I go phor better branch?
[03/06/25, 3:00:41 PM] ~ Suharsh Pal: Any chance CRL 24151
OBC NCL 6608
Koi sa v new iits me lower branch mil skti hai kya ?
[03/06/25, 3:00:46 PM] Dushyant: And one more thing ek baar iit me ghus gaye toh masters ke liye *GATE nahi dena hota* 
Keep this in mind agar age *jake masters karna hai toh*
[03/06/25, 3:00:55 PM] ~ Rajat: Ive heards exactly the opposite of it 😂
[03/06/25, 3:00:56 PM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: What about microelectronics and vlsi instead of electrical? Is it better? Easier? More in demand? Average package was higher that eee last year
[03/06/25, 3:01:12 PM] Dushyant: Where🤨
[03/06/25, 3:01:30 PM] ~ Rajat: Through one of my relatives ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 3:01:46 PM] Dushyant: Tbh physics hai masters mai burden kam karke kya karoge
[03/06/25, 3:02:19 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: It is a Specialization of EE, if you can get this.. then go for it.. else Electrical..b/w them obv. Microelectronics and VLSI, subjects are somewhat similar.. think of it As ECE here ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 3:02:19 PM] ~ Suharsh Pal: Phle pls ye koi btayie
[03/06/25, 3:02:20 PM] Dushyant: Either way relatives have thier way of brainwashing 
Always base your info on real research
[03/06/25, 3:02:30 PM] Ujjwal Singh: See I chose ee over vlsi coz I did not know my interest just like you.
[03/06/25, 3:02:54 PM] Sachit Bansal: Ye to new baat pata chali😂
[03/06/25, 3:02:54 PM] Dushyant: Shyd mandi me bs cs mil sakta hai
[03/06/25, 3:02:54 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: Probably bs interdisciplinary science in iit dharwad
[03/06/25, 3:03:30 PM] ~ Rajat: Thts tru but.... Like mandi is tier 2 and I've already got shittyy rank so I was confused and more diverted to better branch but ig it. Would be in the list
[03/06/25, 3:03:38 PM] ~ Shrestha Kumar: Of course vlsi has better future prospects it gives you specialization and electrical is more of a broader prospect so consider both, both are good no comparison,(i am in electrical engineering) and see previous year data if you can get vlsi, also know the difference between vlsi and electrical engineering, whether it fits what you would like to study. ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 3:03:41 PM] ~ Suharsh Pal: Thanku
[03/06/25, 3:03:51 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: Not possible
[03/06/25, 3:04:08 PM] Dushyant: i thought maybe
[03/06/25, 3:05:30 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: For better understanding please check the josaa closing rank!!!
[03/06/25, 3:05:43 PM] ~ Suharsh Pal: Bhai Cs nhi chahiye lower branch ka possibility hai ya na kisi v iit me bss iit ka seat chahiye
[03/06/25, 3:05:48 PM] Dushyant: Thats tru to agar tume cs karna hai toh you can but but but we have a lot of people in my branch jo mains ke thru cs ja sakte the but came to mandi so dw u aren't the first one to come theu this thought its fine to have such queries
[03/06/25, 3:06:01 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: Bhai wo CS chemical sciences hai🙆🏻‍♂️
[03/06/25, 3:06:15 PM] ~ Rajat: Dhanbad chemical would be better or ep here?
[03/06/25, 3:06:39 PM] Dushyant: Idk abt chemical as a branch 🤧
[03/06/25, 3:07:32 PM] ~ Rajat: Ik that but...... Dar lg tha lower branch lene isliye placement wgera confirm kr rha hu
[03/06/25, 3:08:06 PM] Dushyant: But ik that ep here offera a lot and the sub counceller of the branch himself is doing minors in cs so
[03/06/25, 3:08:50 PM] Dushyant: Lagta hai dw you are not the first abhi bhi final locking of choices me 8 din hai acche se socho aur decisions lo
[03/06/25, 3:09:53 PM] ~ Rajat: Ok
[03/06/25, 3:10:32 PM] ~ Suharsh Pal: Ye bta do mere rank pe
[03/06/25, 3:10:41 PM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: Merit cum means scholarship ka kya scene hai?? Earned credits kya hote h? Aur indiscipline k liye penalty mtlb, limit kya hai? Thoda bahut to safe students karte honge na? Aur uske bad kitni fees lagte h? ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 3:10:47 PM] ~ Rajat: Campus ki photos dekh ke motivate hojaunga 😇
[03/06/25, 3:11:25 PM] Dushyant: And placements ka tension na lo sirf apni skill pe focus karo 
Market hamesa change hota hai
[03/06/25, 3:12:28 PM] ~ Shrestha Kumar: For example: If you had computer science in class 12 then the things that you studied there like boolean logics and gates and number system conversions are related to that of vlsi.
From this you can have knowledge which would be easier for you. ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 3:13:57 PM] Dushyant: Har ek subject ke credits alot hote hai(sort of like token system) har sem me certain credits complete karne hote hai and nahi kiye toh age ke sem me cover karne hote hai total end of 4th year me final credits aur minimum bar of credit match hona chaiye bas

[03/06/25, 3:22:42 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: Fir tho bhai just by luck chance mil jaaye!!! Aur jo mil skti hai wo fir interdisciplinary science branch of iit dharwad
[03/06/25, 3:24:44 PM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: Microelectronics ki last year 6643 thi closing rank, meri 6035 hai to mil jayega na is sal?

[03/06/25, 3:26:35 PM] ~ Shrestha Kumar: Most probably mil jaegi
[03/06/25, 3:26:57 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: toh abhi usse apni preference mai daale rkhna before Electrical.. mil jayega most probably.. baaki clarity uske baad aayegi
[03/06/25, 3:27:10 PM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: Patna me ece + mtech in vlsi (dual) ki 6253 thi, to wo better hoga?
[03/06/25, 3:27:37 PM] ~ Vibha Gandhi: I got 14k rank in advanced and 99.1 percentile in mains
Should I take a drop as I am not getting a satisfactory college?
[03/06/25, 3:28:03 PM] ~ Aryan: Drop mat lena bhai
[03/06/25, 3:28:08 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: wha k curriculum se match krke dekh lo.. aur Placement Records..aur agr phir bhi decide nhi kr pao.. toh phir Campus dekh kr lelena
[03/06/25, 3:28:25 PM] Sachit Bansal: No drop bhai
[03/06/25, 3:28:29 PM] ~ Aryan: Same I got 6014 rank 
What to do?
[03/06/25, 3:29:06 PM] ~ Vibha Gandhi: I think I can improve a lot in drop year as I did many mistakes in my prep
[03/06/25, 3:29:08 PM] Divyansh Jindal: mains se to decent nit mil rhi hogi?
[03/06/25, 3:29:44 PM] ~ Vibha Gandhi: Han par my sole target was iit which I am not getting
[03/06/25, 3:29:45 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: look.. As a Dropper myself.. I am recommending ki if you are getting a good Branch and Clg toh lelo abhi.. drop is a type of Gamble for you
[03/06/25, 3:29:59 PM] ~ Aryan: Exactly
[03/06/25, 3:30:08 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: What if it get worse ?
[03/06/25, 3:30:13 PM] ~ Aryan: Another dropper agreed
[03/06/25, 3:30:14 PM] ~ Aarav: Nit mein dekhlo koyi acchi branch aur nit mil jayegi
[03/06/25, 3:30:26 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Yea none of my dropper friends have improved their ranks even gotten more worse
[03/06/25, 3:30:29 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: Never loose the opportunity you have in your hand!!!
[03/06/25, 3:30:42 PM] ~ Aryan: If you are comfortable what is your category?
[03/06/25, 3:30:47 PM] ~ Vibha Gandhi: General
[03/06/25, 3:30:51 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: yrr wo phir Student pe depend krta h ki wo kitna serious and dedication show kr skta h.. prr opportunity h toh le leni chahiye usse clg
[03/06/25, 3:31:05 PM] ~ Shrestha Kumar: Sare records dekh lo of previous 5 years ( to have better placement knowledge)  compare and see and if you are still confused then again consider the campus life also ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 3:31:21 PM] Divyansh Jindal: And I don't know but partial drop can also be a viable option since you do have a good mains rank. Take a good NIT, and then if you think you can do it prepare for JEE Advanced 2026
[03/06/25, 3:31:26 PM] ~ Aryan: Tab mat lena drop 
Agar bahut jada ghis sakta hai
Like roj paglo jaise tab hi Lena drop warna nit me cse ece lele
[03/06/25, 3:31:44 PM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: Last year meri 15k thi, aur mains me 99.1 drop hi kiya tha maine bhi, is sal ~6k hai mains aur advanced dono me, aur acha ho skta tha bs thodi silly mistakes ho gyi, if you consider this as an improvement to kr skte ho 🤷🏻
[03/06/25, 3:32:31 PM] ~ Aryan: Plus you might get some scholarship in coachings
[03/06/25, 3:33:12 PM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: Yep, mera to free tha
[03/06/25, 3:33:25 PM] ~ Vibha Gandhi: Out of 108 marks in advanced I got only 14 marks in maths I think I have a lot scope for improvement in drop year
[03/06/25, 3:33:36 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: all depends on you.. saari responsibility tumhari.. drop mai acha kr gye toh future tumhara... wrna loss bhi tumhara.. agr shi mai phirse 1 saal ghiss skte ho.. toh krlo.. aasan nhi hoga waps se whi sab for another 1 year... wrna jo opportunity h wo lelo
[03/06/25, 3:34:25 PM] ~ Aryan: Plus coaching lelena 
Kaafi offers milega
[03/06/25, 3:35:25 PM] ~ Vibha Gandhi: How much rank I can expect after drop year
[03/06/25, 3:35:35 PM] Divyansh Jindal: That no one can say.
[03/06/25, 3:35:39 PM] ~ Aryan: It is all upto you
[03/06/25, 3:35:40 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: I personally won't suggest coachings now.. uski already JEE mai achi rank h.. mtlb kaafi kuch already aata h.. toh Ab apne hisab se kro.. prr haan Test Series. ya Advanced batches le skte ho.. that's what i did
[03/06/25, 3:35:46 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bohot wrong question hai bhai
[03/06/25, 3:37:07 PM] ~ Vibha Gandhi: I did lots of mistakes, didn't revise well , neglected maths( full) , etca.nd landed at *14k* rank I think I can improve a lot

[03/06/25, 3:38:17 PM] Vidhi Chandak: Bro it totally depends on the cutoff and the type of paper and your hard work . You cannot say right now what is going to happen . If you actually think that u will be doing a lot better in drop yr then go for it . But i personally will suggest you to go for Partial drop , U will be getting a nice nit through your mains rank . Take that and side by side prepare for Jee too .
[03/06/25, 3:38:28 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: Dekho bhaut simple baat hai... Agr tumhe kayi admission lene ke baad 4 saal tk regret ho ki drop le lena chaiya tha tho lelo but same time pe khud ko ish cheez ke liye ready bhi rakhna agr next year accha nahi jaaye tho abhi ka regret mt krna!!! Choose wisely sometimes it is not about hard-work but luck too!!!

[03/06/25, 3:43:49 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Nahi ,coz fir tumme badmei agar vlsi field achi nahi lagi ya interest kisi aur mei laga toh you will not be able to pursue it  and also if you are doing btech from a IIT then generally you do masters from a better college(IIT/outside).And whatif you don't want to do a mtech,generally btech students get a higher package than mtech, that's why only btech course has a higher cutoff
[03/06/25, 3:45:28 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Higher package I mean when you don't go to RnD after mtech

[03/06/25, 3:52:04 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Another reason can be that since the batch of bio is very less, most of the ones who sat in the placements got quite a good placement.

There is never a  guarantee

[03/06/25, 7:04:16 PM] ~ Arnav Thakur (アルナヴ): It depends on your interest plus if you take ece, you have to study ece and in textile i guess it has minimal study and you will get more time for coding and all
[03/06/25, 7:04:25 PM] ~ Pranit: Also how is IIT Jodhpur in comparison to IIT Mandi for CS
[03/06/25, 7:05:04 PM] ~ Arnav Thakur (アルナヴ): Ece new branch introduce hori hai ig in IIT mandi

But it will give you a core tech placement as well as an upper edge in IT placements as well
[03/06/25, 7:09:04 PM] ~ MS: IIT jodhpur CSE or IIT Mandi CSE which better
[03/06/25, 7:09:20 PM] Sameer Batra: !!

[03/06/25, 7:09:57 PM] Navedhya Goyal: **
[03/06/25, 7:12:23 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Mandi, much better placements
[03/06/25, 7:13:53 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: Those who wonder what coding culture actually is (mujhe bhi phle smjh nhi ata tha)
Active tech clubs
Frequent Hackathons (believe me, hmare yha enough hoti h)
Sessions and interest among people towards tech
[03/06/25, 7:16:36 PM] Harshit Jain: IIT Mandi has a vibrant and growing coding culture if that's your concern. ‎<This message was edited>

[03/06/25, 7:20:08 PM] Dushyant: And iit mandi has a course DP (design practicum) where you design a solution out of a problem statement and if the project you designed is good the assisting professor might continue it for furthur innovation ‎<This message was edited>

[03/06/25, 7:57:35 PM] Priyansh Saha: i think there is an option for a minor degree in intelligent systems
[03/06/25, 7:57:50 PM] Prabhnoor Singh Mann: Well first things first there is some overlap in VLSI and CSE and working in that space may be very beneficial for you given your academic load

But apart from this once you get the general flow of the semester and key deadlines its really about what you prioritize and how you handle yourself and carve out the time

Plus you will have a lot of support from your peers in terms of managing coursework and by that time you yourself will know what type of projects to pursue given your situation ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 7:59:04 PM] Pranab Pandey: Well you have a course in ML in second year that is there for all branches and also there's DL that you can opt for

[03/06/25, 8:48:53 PM] ~ M M Mittal: Engineering Physics kesi branch hai
[03/06/25, 8:49:19 PM] Dushyant: Engineering Physics (EP) at IIT Mandi is a unique program, which is designed to prepare graduates with a rigorous foundation in Physics along with Engineering in order to tackle today’s technology challenges. EP will enhance the cross-functionality and bridge the gap between pure science and traditional engineering disciplines which conventionally are pursued independently. This is necessary because in today’s world major scientific and technological breakthroughs happen in a multi-disciplinary environment where scientists from pure science work along with engineers. It is, therefore, highly important to inculcate both scientific and technological aspects, and the EP program will serve this purpose.

[03/06/25, 11:00:43 PM] Nishant Kaushik: Never prefer nirf
[03/06/25, 11:01:00 PM] Aryan Garg: I almost had same rank and i am currently in Data Science and i have no regrets and i don't think i will have any regrets in future too
[03/06/25, 11:01:15 PM] Arihant Jain: even dse is almost same in terms of packages
[03/06/25, 11:01:48 PM] Krish Bhagat: Nirf takes into account many factors such as location which are somewhat relevant but have no direct correlation

what will be better if i want to persue ms from abroad??

[03/06/25, 11:41:43 PM] ~ Vishal: I am guessing dhanbad
[03/06/25, 11:41:50 PM] ~ Aakarsh Singhal: What should i consider 
1.  Kgp- ocean or mining
2. Guwahati- biotech
3. ⁠bhu- civil or meta 
4. ⁠ mandi- mec
[03/06/25, 11:42:50 PM] ~ Tahir: Hey , how is the materials science course at mandi
[03/06/25, 11:43:14 PM] Aryan Garg: I would prefer dhanbad chemical
As it is clearly better than patna
And IIT Mandi civil is fine too but if you are okay with chemistry then Dhanbad Chemical is better
[03/06/25, 11:43:33 PM] ~ Nishtha ✨: they are saying mining, metallurgy, petroleum is better there 
so saying to consider patna but i am a bit confused
[03/06/25, 11:43:57 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: lekin bhaiya palcements to kam hai chemical vagerah ke

[03/06/25, 11:45:15 PM] ~ Tahir: I'm preferring it over ropar and gandhinagar due to the campus
[03/06/25, 11:45:17 PM] Aryan Garg: If you want to persue ms in abroad then CG and projects/researches are majorly considered so choose something you think you can score good cgpa in and also you have enough time to focus on extra skills for projects and researches

[03/06/25, 11:46:33 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: okk
[03/06/25, 11:46:48 PM] Aryan Garg: Better for furthur research purposes and furthur studies, if you want to go for placements i would say both are not preferred by me neither civil nor chemical ‎<This message was edited>
[03/06/25, 11:47:35 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok
[03/06/25, 11:48:18 PM] ~ Vishal: No idea
[03/06/25, 11:48:33 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: with 4282 obc ncl rank can i get general engineering , last year cutoff is 4693
[03/06/25, 11:49:06 PM] Pranshu Gupta: Material Science at IIT Mandi is quite strong, offering multiple opportunities in both the private and government sectors. Additionally, there are excellent prospects for pursuing advanced research and higher studies. And you have a lot of time ( in comparison to other branches) for any other skill development, if you wish.
[03/06/25, 11:49:15 PM] Pranshu Gupta: Don't!
[03/06/25, 11:49:35 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ??
[03/06/25, 11:49:46 PM] Aryan Garg: Well to be honest you focus on campus only during your first 4-5 months or either for trips nearby otherwise its environment that matters for good mood to study, still if you think that excluding the environment factor you prefer something then i would go for that cause everyone naturally adapts wherever they go 
People are in Jodhpur hot weathers too and jammu cold weathers too and mandi clean air too and delhi.... too
[03/06/25, 11:49:48 PM] ~ Tahir: Why? Is the difference in teaching large enough
[03/06/25, 11:49:51 PM] Shivam Soni: I think so
[03/06/25, 11:50:11 PM] ~ Nishtha ✨: yeahh right...so shld i take up mandi?
as i more inclined towards chem tbh but ig mandi better clg wise?
[03/06/25, 11:50:26 PM] Chinmay Gupta: I would suggest Mandi civil.
You will get adequate time to focus on other hobbies and specialisations
[03/06/25, 11:50:33 PM] ~ Tahir: So is gandhinagar a better choice?
[03/06/25, 11:50:39 PM] Chinmay Gupta: And Mandi is a better college
[03/06/25, 11:50:49 PM] ~ Tahir: I also have bhu meta but no interest in meta so not sure if I should consider
[03/06/25, 11:51:23 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: jo mock allocation me milega vo 1 round tk milega ya aakhri tk bhi mil skta hai
[03/06/25, 11:51:33 PM] Aryan Garg: Well placements campus and environment and research and innovation stats are improving progressively and already at good level
Still there is much time so consider all possibilities just so you don't think later that you hurried and took wrong decision
[03/06/25, 11:51:59 PM] Pranshu Gupta: I don't know about the amount of difference between these two but I can surely say that you'll have better opportunities there in terms of both academic and non academic aspects.
[03/06/25, 11:52:14 PM] ~ Nishtha ✨: i would have to maintain acads...and i dont really have that much interest in civil
[03/06/25, 11:52:35 PM] Aryan Garg: Depends on your interest as CG definately matters and also which branch you are getting as some companies place criteria for that too
[03/06/25, 11:52:44 PM] ~ Nishtha ✨: but is a better clg....so in dilemma
[03/06/25, 11:52:57 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: then don't opt.. you will regret opting such thing in which you don't have interest..
[03/06/25, 11:53:03 PM] Chinmay Gupta: Acads har subject mein maintain karne padte hain
Chemical might end up being heavier than civil as engineering differs significantly from your 12th class coursework
[03/06/25, 11:53:08 PM] ~ Revanth Akkineni: Its better to look into branch wise standards in the options you have asked there are often times a branch in a worse rated college could be better than a branch in a better rated college
[03/06/25, 11:53:10 PM] ~ Nishtha ✨: oohh ohkk
truee i will!
[03/06/25, 11:53:27 PM] ~ Revanth Akkineni: If you are only interested in going to IT and CS side its probably better to go to the better institute
[03/06/25, 11:53:50 PM] ~ Revanth Akkineni: But if you want core you should consider properly researching the curriculum
[03/06/25, 11:53:59 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: Your branch and Interest should be your priority over your clg
[03/06/25, 11:54:00 PM] ~ Nishtha ✨: truee obv...bas the thing is interest banana padega in civil

[03/06/25, 11:54:20 PM] Pranshu Gupta: You might develop the interest but if you do have interest or want to go the IT or CS side then going for a better college would be a better choice.
[03/06/25, 11:54:26 PM] ~ Bhavya Garg: Does anyone know about IIIT banglore cs? Is it comparable to iit ropar or mandi cs?
[03/06/25, 11:54:29 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ???
[03/06/25, 11:54:34 PM] Chinmay Gupta: Fair enoug
[03/06/25, 11:55:29 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: interest bnana would be difficult..and for 1 year you will study common subjects.. 1st year you will be studying only 1 subject of civil so for 1 year you won't be able to make interest
[03/06/25, 11:55:44 PM] ~ Rhydam Sharma: prefer ropar ig
[03/06/25, 11:56:00 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: for placements , iiitb is better bur for overall development iit are better
[03/06/25, 11:56:01 PM] Aryan Garg: For everyone,
1. Don't ever think of choosing any branch which you don't have interest in. *Students fail in IIT exams too* not because they are tough but *because they don't feel the need or urge or interest* to study that. 
2. Trust me *no course is too tough*, you all have cleared JEE advance and JEE mains level study is enough for any branch.
3. When we say a branch courses are tough we are saying that they are *_comparatively tough_*
[03/06/25, 11:56:14 PM] ~ Nishtha ✨: that is true

what r ur opinions on patna chem?
[03/06/25, 11:56:19 PM] ~ Revanth Akkineni: I dont know about the curriculum in the other option but here we have 4 specializations or minors which include computers and AI, Semiconductors, quantum materials etc, other college may also have metallurgy added in the course name so check that and also look at how kuch freedom they are giving in terms of course selection
[03/06/25, 11:57:33 PM] Shivam Soni: Nah aisa nahi hota
Last year first round me delhi mech mila tha but end me nahi mila
[03/06/25, 11:57:41 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: Yes , You can Opt for it.. I have been to Patna Campus.. and their academic Infrastructure is Better than that of here.. and You will be studying what you have interest in.. You will Surely do well 👍

[03/06/25, 11:59:41 PM] Aryan Garg: And one last point
4. If we are preffering not to take a course a major reason of that could be that you don't get enough time for extra skills or projects or hackathons. As these really do matter a lot, these skills and projects are the things which are added in resumes and checked in interviews or furthur admissions and any institute course is not considered cause all the students in your discipline have studied the same, this extra time which you use productively is what makes highest packages and lowest packages...
[04/06/25, 12:00:01 AM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya jo mock allocatino me milta hai vo final hota hai ki milega hi milega
[04/06/25, 12:00:37 AM] Shivam Soni: Nope

[04/06/25, 12:00:41 AM] ~ Vikrant Singh: nhii.. kyoki uske baad log preference chance krte h.. toh chances that you might land into a different branch
[04/06/25, 12:01:07 AM] Aryan Garg: Hm that is an idea and has 99+ percent chance but still round 1 is completely different matter
[04/06/25, 12:01:25 AM] ~ Vikrant Singh: Class 12th Marksheet Would be better
[04/06/25, 12:01:29 AM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok so
[04/06/25, 12:01:48 AM] ~ MANEK YADAV: suggest branch with 4282 obc rank
[04/06/25, 12:02:19 AM] ~ MANEK YADAV: and college also
[04/06/25, 12:02:20 AM] Saksham setia: Adding to the third point 

Grading in most subjects is relative so it does not matter that much if the subject is too tough as what grade you will get will be decided by class's median
[04/06/25, 12:02:53 AM] Aryan Garg: Bro that would take a lot of time to check that which branches you are getting

[04/06/25, 12:35:49 AM] Anish Kumar: I think mandi ee will be best 
At last you have to study most of the courses from your branch and as branch proceeds with further year courses weight also increases like we had also done 1-2 courses this year which were ic courses and they were hectic as we don't like them.

Same issue I think you'll face with gpt branch 

Like ee you'll have core courses from electrical which might be better.
As per your interest.

And many people from gpt are entering into coding stuff and all 

And for campus scenes you will feel good for 4-6 months.

I would recommend just go through curriculum and then decide

[04/06/25, 12:44:57 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: just out of curiousity ....... Mandi is in a remote location , even then uska placement (including those opting for higher studies ) was 99% in the year 2022-23 , even though iit Hyderabad , which had approximately same batch size had 98% for this particular academic year . dono mein placement : higher studies ka ratio almost same hai . Also Hyderabad being such a big city has a median of 21 whereas Mandi has 22 . So how is mandi doing so well ?
[04/06/25, 12:45:16 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: data : NIRF ka pdf
[04/06/25, 12:46:00 AM] Divyansh Jindal: We have a very strong placement cell and lower strength. Both of those factors matter the most in placements
[04/06/25, 12:46:34 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: what makes the placement cell strong ?
[04/06/25, 12:47:24 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Just strong connections and leadership. If the head and the people in the cell are capable they can bring a lot of stuff

[04/06/25, 12:49:11 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: nearest main city tak jaane mein kitna time lagta hai ?
[04/06/25, 12:49:15 AM] Piyush Roy: Also, things like Ai/DS, iit mandi kafi invest Kiya hai last few years meh soo that's why placement jyada hai
[04/06/25, 12:50:41 AM] ~ Sahil Choudhary: ‎~ Sahil Choudhary joined using this group's invite link
[04/06/25, 12:49:52 AM] Piyush Roy: The nearest city is chandigarh and it's about 3-4 hr.
[04/06/25, 12:50:23 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: toh aaj kal ache companies are willing to come to remote areas also ?
[04/06/25, 12:50:58 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Why wouldn't they. If they find skilled people they are more than willing. Just see another example of BITS Pilani
[04/06/25, 12:51:27 AM] Piyush Roy: Why not, students matter karte hai location nahi
[04/06/25, 12:51:46 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: Ooo .... Thanks a lot bhaiyas
[04/06/25, 12:51:59 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: Kharagpur ka toh 86 hai par
[04/06/25, 12:52:49 AM] Piyush Roy: See there are many reasons for it 

Agar tum consistently paas ho rahe ho, 7+ grade rakh rahe ho and skills sikh rahe ho tho placement lag jayegi
[04/06/25, 12:53:04 AM] Sachit Bansal: hm hm
[04/06/25, 12:53:57 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: who toh hai par aisa nahi bol sakte ki Kharagpur ke baccho mein ye quality jyada hone ki chances hai kyunki wahan seats upar ki closing ranks pe band ho jaate hai ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 12:55:27 AM] Piyush Roy: See jee different hai as compared to college life, ranks matter nahi karti itni jab college meh aajao, tum consistent rahoge tho sorted hai

[04/06/25, 1:02:37 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Roper AI kaafi neeche ayega iss baar btw.
[04/06/25, 1:02:40 AM] Aryan Garg: Nahi nahi its just to bring in our notice that someone in groups need help related to DSAI
[04/06/25, 1:02:49 AM] Aryan Garg: Hm i too think so
[04/06/25, 1:02:59 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Seats 20 se 80 hui hai
[04/06/25, 1:03:18 AM] ~ Shriansh Shegokar: Ropar upar h sc quota me..
[04/06/25, 1:03:22 AM] Aryan Garg: 60 tha ya 80?
[04/06/25, 1:04:09 AM] ~ Shriansh Shegokar: Bahut upar close ho gya tha last yr
[04/06/25, 1:04:11 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Brother tier 3 iit mat jaana IMO. Kyuki alumni network aur weak hoga, aur worse facilities in terms of courses n all. Tier 2 tk hi dekho
[04/06/25, 1:04:42 AM] Aryan Garg: Oh i see well between ropar AI and Mandi DSE definately Mandi cause AI in ropar is a new branch and has no pre placement stats, and here DSE packages almost match CSE packages so...
[04/06/25, 1:04:48 AM] ~ Shriansh Shegokar: What about iit Patna 5 yr course?
[04/06/25, 1:05:08 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Bs Kr kitna compare Krega cse DSE ko bhai.
[04/06/25, 1:05:37 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Those ones with IIMs?
[04/06/25, 1:05:50 AM] ~ Shriansh Shegokar: Yea
[04/06/25, 1:06:06 AM] ~ Shriansh Shegokar: Dual degree wala bhi to hai
[04/06/25, 1:06:27 AM] Aryan Garg: Bhai compare ni kr rha...... mtlb haan compare hi hai but .... i mean facho ko sahi se samjh bhi toh aana chahiye point...
[04/06/25, 1:07:15 AM] Divyansh Jindal: I mean if you want go for the IIM Mumbai ones but it's better if you go for btech if you want just a job. Baaki regarding any iit patna's branches u should ask in their group they will tell the ground reality
[04/06/25, 1:08:02 AM] ~ Shriansh Shegokar: Ok thanks a lot 🙏🏻😊
[04/06/25, 1:08:53 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Vaise yeh yaad rakhna ropar me seats increase hone ki vajah se knockoff effect mandi Patna jodhpur pr bhi ayega. Agar if you think dsai mil rhi h aur cse nhi mandi me fir bhi cse bhar dena. (Just saying based on ranks)
[04/06/25, 1:09:33 AM] ~ Ritika Verma’25: knockoff effect kya hota hai
[04/06/25, 1:10:09 AM] ~ Shriansh Shegokar: Actually iss effect ko consider kr ke hi ropar me Ai milega😂
[04/06/25, 1:10:50 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Like ropar me seats double hui h cse me, to unki closing rank to lower jayegi hi, lekin uske karan hamari bhi lower ho jayegi. Kyuki log past years ke data consider krke bharte h to usually ropar ko mandi se upar rakhte hai. (Agar this is all just based on data I'm not commenting on this myself)
[04/06/25, 1:11:11 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Acha fir thik h

[04/06/25, 1:51:46 AM] Sachit Bansal: personal opinion
[04/06/25, 1:52:00 AM] ~ Ayushman Shukla: Wahi to dikkat h, abhi aap keh rhe to man nhi skta na, electrical to fir bhi evergreen si branch h, vlsi ka record nhi h koi placement ka package ka, to risky situation hai 🙂
[04/06/25, 1:52:30 AM] Sachit Bansal: placement placement placement. are bhai lag jayegi

[04/06/25, 3:04:39 AM] Madhav Aggarwal: You should also consider Bioengineering at Mandi, considering that it has had better placement stats than all other non-circuital branches(barring last and this year)
[04/06/25, 3:05:14 AM] Madhav Aggarwal: also, not a hectic branch and gives you the opportunity to do whatever you want to with your time
[04/06/25, 3:06:34 AM] Madhav Aggarwal: It also has a great faculty and networking ecosystem setup
[04/06/25, 3:07:06 AM] Madhav Aggarwal: apart from all these, I would highly recommend that you consider Bioengineering as well ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 3:13:28 AM] Devansh Popli: And also if you are worried about biology, professors will teach each concept from the very basic, no prior knowledge is required,

Also the course does not only have core biology concepts, it includes electronics, mechanics and coding related stuff too. ‎<This message was edited>

[04/06/25, 7:52:48 AM] ~ Sahil Choudhary: Toh civil ya material science and engineering which one is better
[04/06/25, 7:56:49 AM] Pranshu Gupta: I think you should go for materials, as you get lot of options here, like double majors and minors you can do easily here, we have some interesting specializations, research area is vast open and many psus come looking for us.

[04/06/25, 7:58:39 AM] ~ DIGVIJAY SINGH GOIL: What should I chose bhaiya iit mandi DS and AI or IITB energy/civil engineering (have no such interest coding want to build good connections and network)
[04/06/25, 8:03:42 AM] Pranshu Gupta: @919741394226 @919501106331
[04/06/25, 8:11:08 AM] ~ Garv Jain: If you want only connections then go for IITB(although decent and a good amount of connections are also possible in mandi). And you can choose energy. It is a new field but seems promising
[04/06/25, 8:13:17 AM] ~ DIGVIJAY SINGH GOIL: Okay bhaiya thank you
[04/06/25, 8:14:38 AM] Ujjwal Singh: Between Ropar ee and IIT Mandi ee/vlsi ,there is not much difference as in terms of placement stats as of earlier years but what I know surely about my IIT is that in Mandi the tech culture is really increasing a lot ,the clubs are very active there's ton of hackathons(seriously lots of them that are given by companies of inter IIT),seniors help a lot ,we have new courses which are not in others especially in 1st and 2nd year that are FDP(in case you take ee) ,DP for all,3 data science courses for all,ML and DL courses that you can take and this is till now we know you can take courses like intelligent systems/control systems a lot more over these 4 years.
One more thing like I also had a confusion between Ropar and Mandi I found out that according to their senior who got the highest package in 2024 he told me that acad at Ropar is very hectic and a lot of stuff is not useful unlike IIIT H where acad is hectic but the courses are very good and they benefit in future so don't think of it that way.You should not compare by placement stats only coz those are just initial they don't determine your career as such you should also think that these 4 years won't be repeated and think where you can explore new stuff at the same time enjoy yourself as well coz I always say you realize how good Mandi is after you reach home .

[04/06/25, 8:32:27 AM] Dushyant: Its beneficial if you are doing btech u dont need to enroll in them right now
[04/06/25, 8:33:07 AM] ~ Jagrut Garg: Thanku bhaiya
[04/06/25, 8:33:18 AM] ~ Garv Jain: See I don’t have much detailed info about other IITs but mandi would be better between these. The environment in mandi supports coding and related activities. The institute is investing a lot in ai and related field so indirectly helping the CSE people. Course is more or less same everywhere but here you have more flexibility to choose. The course choices are slowly increasing.

Dhanbad has only recently turned into an IIT from ISM so no major changes related to CSE have been made till now

Jodhpur and Patna are similar but not as good as mandi. The thing that makes them seem close to mandi is their placement stat (closer to big cities).

So the people and the institute’s increasing attention and investment has made mandi CSE better both in skill dev and placement 

For more info you can ask @918860060837, @918383061078 and other IIT grps
[04/06/25, 8:34:01 AM] ~ Sri: In the placement stats I can see highest and lowest packages offered for 2021-2025 academic session.
[04/06/25, 8:34:20 AM] ~ Sri: Any idea about the average and median packages
[04/06/25, 8:36:16 AM] ~ Jagrut Garg: Bhaiya like if main abhi solo trips karna chahta hun before college toh uski jagah karna yeh thik hai for better exposure and experience before btech?

For better exposure things like TIP induction programs will be held by clubs where you will be given opportunity for learning new things so dw now you'll have enough opportunities ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 8:41:32 AM] ~ Sunny Raj: Details about EP
[04/06/25, 8:41:57 AM] Dushyant: Engineering Physics (EP) at IIT Mandi is a unique program, which is designed to prepare graduates with a rigorous foundation in Physics along with Engineering in order to tackle today’s technology challenges. EP will enhance the cross-functionality and bridge the gap between pure science and traditional engineering disciplines which conventionally are pursued independently. This is necessary because in today’s world major scientific and technological breakthroughs happen in a multi-disciplinary environment where scientists from pure science work along with engineers. It is, therefore, highly important to inculcate both scientific and technological aspects, and the EP program will serve this purpose.

Are they allowed to sit in circuital placement?
[04/06/25, 8:44:00 AM] Dushyant: +EP is a very chill branch which allows its students to persue things apart from traditional courses, whatever you like (like a minor in cse or even management) 
Tbh first year me EP sabse chill that in terms of academics
[04/06/25, 8:44:41 AM] Dushyant: Yes if you wish you can opt for electives from circuitual courses
[04/06/25, 8:45:18 AM] Dushyant: Which allows you to sit for such jobs
[04/06/25, 8:47:14 AM] ~ Hp: are you referring to minor courses ?
[04/06/25, 8:48:12 AM] Dushyant: Yes and no

EP or Chemical
[04/06/25, 8:50:14 AM] Dushyant: EP because chemical is more research based
[04/06/25, 8:51:01 AM] Dushyant: EP is also research based but thats optional you can go and have a minor in any degree you want

Good placement track record for EE
[04/06/25, 8:52:39 AM] Dushyant: There's no cgp bar you can just opt for courses necessary

[04/06/25, 8:57:32 AM] Chinmay Gupta: EE waalon ko Mandi mein best courses offer hote hain 
Including almost all the courses offered to CSE and DSE
This is because both EE and CSE fall under the school of computing and electrical engineering (SCEE)
Toh because of a common governing body EE and VLSI get lot of opportunities to explore courses in CSE domains
[04/06/25, 8:58:39 AM] ~ ~Shivam Deuty: Where is MnC better 
Ropar, Dhanbad or Mandi??
[04/06/25, 9:11:00 AM] ~ Vikrant Singh: I have been to Patna during the InterIIT cult meet .. and trust me you will find better Hostel Infra here, much much better.. better environment for everything, acads and Other activities also, as for acads. IIT Mandi VLSI/EE > IIT Patna ECE/EEE..Mandi Offers lots of Interesting Courses to offer with Open Houses and support from profs. also.. yes They are the most hectic in acads, we have the opportunity to explore CS courses also... We have an very Active clubs providing lots of opportunities in this domains...
[04/06/25, 9:21:42 AM] ~ Preeti: Iit mandi mechanical or nit kurukshetra electronics or nit kurukshetra MnC ?
[04/06/25, 9:24:05 AM] Jay Shah: If you are just going for the IIT tag, I don't think any will make a difference, and any of previous three are better because they are older and carry more prestige. If you are interested in pursuing mech, you should go for Mandi (i.e if you are not straight forward going to code and plan to enter CSE domains)

[04/06/25, 9:42:02 AM] ~ Dr Srinivas Ragi: Same
[04/06/25, 9:42:29 AM] Shubh Kashyap: DSE is essentially a specialization of CSE, with extra focus on data analysis, machine learning, AI, and statistics. Core programming and computer science concepts are still taught in DSE.
[04/06/25, 9:43:24 AM] Shivam Soni: It is very close, in much of the cases the placement packages are the same, and there are a lot of similarities in the curriculum
[04/06/25, 9:44:26 AM] Shubh Kashyap: Yes, absolutely. In fact, many IT companies actively recruit DSE students, especially for roles like  Software Developer / Engineer,Data Scientist / Analyst , Machine Learning Engineer
AI Engineer , Business Analyst ,Data Engineer , Backend / Full Stack Developer .
[04/06/25, 9:44:59 AM] Prabhnoor Singh Mann: You take a lot of similar courses with CSE MnC so the placement scenario is also similar

[04/06/25, 10:59:59 AM] Shivam Soni: Dekho if you just want to do coding or finance then civil is the best line to pick but the downside is the lack of fulfilling placements for the same, not all companies allow non circuital branches to sit for placements and you wouldn't have the edge over people in circuital so you would have to be really good at what you do to have a good change at good on campus placements

Induction Programme to Make you aware of different different options.. and Career Streams to pursue..Dedicated Labs, 

Hostels:- Patna Hostel is almost 1 KM away from their Academic Buildings.. and Mess is almost near to the Hostel. so you will have to travel a lot. yes they provide bicycles but in summers it's extremely Hot, also boys and girls have separate mess there .. they have buildings with 7-8 floors and Imagine living on the top floor in Summers without AC, and you won't find Any Pigs and Neelgai, roaming in IIT Mandi Campus

[04/06/25, 11:39:27 AM] ~ ★★★J'25: Bhaiya interest to cse mein hi tha but 12.2k adv and 20.4k mains mein to cse lower colleges mein hi mil raha


So I decided to learn coding related and other skills for non core placements while taking up a branch which will leave me with ample time for this..and won't be hectic
[04/06/25, 11:41:22 AM] ~ Tushar: Same my adv rank is 13k and mains rank is 26k and general male
[04/06/25, 11:41:34 AM] ~ Tushar: Same suggestion would work for me
[04/06/25, 11:44:26 AM] Nishant Kaushik: I would choose 11
[04/06/25, 11:45:01 AM] ~ ★★★J'25: Plz elaborate

[04/06/25, 11:47:04 AM] Aryan Garg: I would choose 4 or 11
Cause you would be in great places and in 4 you are already in core so developing skills in the same field would be easy
And 11 cause you will get much time to develop skills and in all IITs there are free electives you can simply choose IT related courses and IITs give many opportunities and especially Hyderabad is a great choice among the IITs and branches you listed ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 11:48:08 AM] Aryan Garg: Sorry 11

[04/06/25, 11:50:10 AM] ~ Karan'25: And if i had to compare between mandi dsai and patna cse which should be higher? I m confused because one is core cse and the other is specialisation which often needs masters

[04/06/25, 11:52:23 AM] ~ Karan'25: I heard entry level jobs are low in number with limited pay, major companies need one to have mtech degrees

[04/06/25, 11:53:20 AM] ~ Vikrant Singh: can check placement records they are on par with CSE and it is a well established branch here which is highly promoted
[04/06/25, 11:53:33 AM] Aryan Garg: Nope check placements stats, last year DSAI has better stats than IIT ropar CSE

[04/06/25, 11:59:40 AM] Arihant Jain: btw i myself got 2k rank and had these options along with ropar cse too
[04/06/25, 12:00:17 PM] Ujjwal Singh: See you can go for Mandi ee or Dhanbad ECE 
Its just that in Mandi the tech culture is growing rapidly the courses here are very flexible,the research is very good,there are lots of hackathons and competition held,new courses aligned to industry and future are part of curriculum and there are other points also which you can check of mine and @918533972844 which we have mentioned above whereas Dhanbad is older but it had become an IIT in 2016 only and can't say much of actual tech culture in Dhanbad.
[04/06/25, 12:01:31 PM] Aryan Garg: Well the closest well functioning airport is in chandigarh which is just 4 hours form IIT Mandi and the two campuses are only 10 minute apart, 
Placements are better here, the travel buses are luxurious cause it falls in the route chandigarh to manali and there is a health centre inside both campuses and if need nearest hospital is 50 min drive which the institute ambulance takes you and landslides are very very rare like once in 2 3 months now, and new route is being built between both campuses which will furthur reduce the time delay
[04/06/25, 12:01:48 PM] Arihant Jain: kullu airport?
[04/06/25, 12:01:58 PM] Aryan Garg: Not well functioning i would say
[04/06/25, 12:01:58 PM] Sameer Batra: Yupp
[04/06/25, 12:03:22 PM] Vidhi Chandak: Well You may search the official website to have a look at the medical facilities available here . Sports facilities are on both the campus , It's just for a few outdoor sports that you will have to travel to other campus and that too will take only 5-10 mints . Also acc to me , Small campus is much better and also not to mention the weather here at mandi
[04/06/25, 12:04:08 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: also to add that landslides happens during Monsoon
[04/06/25, 12:04:12 PM] Divyansh Jindal: See not only this but I would recommend that in general you shouldn't consider travel as a factor when deciding a college. You'll only be going home max 4 times a year during the breaks and deciding your life based on this seems like a bad idea
[04/06/25, 12:05:06 PM] Aryan Garg: Bro speaking facts...
[04/06/25, 12:06:51 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Yeah also ask them how much of a struggle it's for them to go from their rooms to classes and then to mess ,our space might be limited but all important stuff have been made already,its just that they get single room in first year we get sharing so if that is the issue think of everyday travel and not from home to Mandi which I suppose everybody thought that it is tough in Mandi but it's not that tough get the  night bus from Delhi and reach Mandi in the morning from where institute busses are available.
[04/06/25, 12:06:51 PM] ~ Aditya: Ok
[04/06/25, 12:07:28 PM] ~ Shivang25: What kind of rubbish is it
[04/06/25, 12:09:08 PM] ~ Karan'25: All i m sure in terms of placements iit bbsr is one of the lower ranked iits
[04/06/25, 12:09:41 PM] Jay Shah: It is good
[04/06/25, 12:10:05 PM] Arihant Jain: yup at this point iit patna cse>iit kanpur cse due to travel😂😂
[04/06/25, 12:10:37 PM] ~ Karan'25: By the way someone said if u have a certain cgpa u can opt for single occupancy room? Whats the cgpa we are talking about here?
[04/06/25, 12:10:42 PM] Sameer Batra: I think travel should be the last aspect to be considered while joining a college
[04/06/25, 12:10:59 PM] Priyansh Saha: can confirm, i live in bangalore (all the way south)  and i have no regrets choosing iit mandi
[04/06/25, 12:11:08 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: nope.. not single rooms.. there were 2 sharing rooms
[04/06/25, 12:11:11 PM] Arihant Jain: i think its 9.1 ish something right?……depends every year tho

[04/06/25, 12:12:33 PM] Arihant Jain: dew turns to ice in december month in morning….snowfall is rare
[04/06/25, 12:12:45 PM] Nishant Kaushik: Haha ,yes

[04/06/25, 12:13:04 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: Patna is also very far from Patna Junc. like it took us more than 1.5 hrs from Patna toh IIT Patna..
[04/06/25, 12:13:16 PM] ~ Karan'25: 40 kms
[04/06/25, 12:13:23 PM] Priyansh Saha: not for all branches, the others had engineering drawing
[04/06/25, 12:13:28 PM] Divyansh Jindal: They aren't compulsory. If you want you can drop it but it's not recommended. 
Also, ropar and roorkee also has it from what I know

[04/06/25, 12:15:12 PM] ~ Karan'25: Oh i see
[04/06/25, 12:16:32 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: yess but. since Mandi isn't that much crowded so you can reach mandi in less than an hour.. if by cab, it will take 30-35 mins
[04/06/25, 12:16:56 PM] ~ Karan'25: Okay, i assume there are public transport services?
[04/06/25, 12:17:09 PM] Jay Shah: Yes, but I believe it is not a part of curriculum now, we have HST now, which does not have those parts that intensively
[04/06/25, 12:17:38 PM] Divyansh Jindal: There are public buses as well as our own college buses running every hour from Mandi to IIT to and fro
[04/06/25, 12:17:43 PM] Nishant Kaushik: Also but u don't need public transport for mandi to campus

Bahar k logo ko koi reality pata hi nhi h yaha ki. They think its a remote village, but uts nothing like that. National importance ka college h, abd facilities saari avaialbe h
Rahi baat area ki, to they should google it. Its 540+ acres. And we have got about 120 acres more on 1 Jan this year at Palampur. That area will also be developed under IIT Mandi. ‎<This message was edited>

[04/06/25, 12:45:05 PM] Pranab Pandey: I would suggest either go for iit mandi CSE if you have interest in software and AI things and all
Otherwise IIT Delhi chemical is good. It is one of the really underrated branches according to me

[04/06/25, 12:48:28 PM] Dushyant: Ok i will only say on last point 
Mandi Himachal pradesh me ata hai joki ek tourust location hai so accessibility issue nahi hai aur bat rahi ac rooms ki toh humare rooms ko ac ki nhi heater ki jarurat padhti

[04/06/25, 12:56:50 PM] ~ Garv Jain: Dekho accessibility is not an issue as everything you need is in the campus itself(food, stationary, supermarket, infirmary, Amazon, etc) and for other stuff you have the mandi city which is 30-40min away and to which college bus does regularly. 
For other as they are near city. So there might not be as many facilities in the campus for which they need to go out. That’s why they might be emphasising the big city fact ‎<This message was edited>

[04/06/25, 1:01:33 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: Depends on you my guy

If you know you wouldn't work in core then you might take any branch and would prefer a better college.

But if you have interest in some then maybe take a branch and thus college according to your interest.

Trust me if you don't have that much research interest you don't wanna choose bsc over btech.

Do these steps automatically many things will filter out. ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 1:02:17 PM] ~ Garv Jain: Placement hamne bhi dali hai of the recent year and unhone bhi dali hogi. You can compare on your own. Dont need to blindly listen. Agar unhone only selected year ki dali hai then you know what it means ..

[04/06/25, 1:08:33 PM] Dushyant: There might be discripancies btw the to branches for this but EP has a strong point of offering the most displine elective to chose from in almost all fields like cse, dsa, vlsi etc so if you want a tech job you can choose these courses and gain the relevent skills throught clubs and apply for jobs
[04/06/25, 1:08:47 PM] ~ SANGITA KUMARI: ..
[04/06/25, 1:09:51 PM] Dushyant: Tbh i wont be as such worried abt a tech job as preferences change after coming to college and yours might
Just keep in mind that EP offers the flexibility you want
[04/06/25, 1:10:17 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: I would have chosen dhanbad (Indian School of Mines). Though it also depends what branch you are comparing
[04/06/25, 1:10:54 PM] ~ SANGITA KUMARI: Mining with mme(mandi)
[04/06/25, 1:11:06 PM] ~ Garv Jain: Jo branches ISM mei exist karti thi, they would be better there rest they might be better here as Dhanbad became an IIT way latter

[04/06/25, 1:21:38 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: InterIIT is a very dynamic thing. just because they did good this time that doesn't mean they will continue to do so..
[04/06/25, 1:21:43 PM] ~ Mohit Joshi: You can explore every field or every club there are no restrictions in any clubs. If we talk about placements, IIT P is doing better than most of the 2nd gen IIT
[04/06/25, 1:22:27 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: Core jaise mining/civil mei interest hai?
In terms of bioeng
Mandi>jodhpur>bhu
(But jodhpur has branch change available)

Dhanbad's mining has good core  placement stats over the years.
[04/06/25, 1:22:31 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: so does here.. no restriction in any club , whether to join or to Participate
[04/06/25, 1:22:44 PM] ~ Mohit Joshi: They are doing it continuously from 3-4 years, it shows that there is a good culture for tech

[04/06/25, 1:23:20 PM] ~ Aayush: tbh if you guys aren't preferred on a branch then IIT Dhanbad Mining is the best here since ISM has an extremely good reputation in the industrial field.
[04/06/25, 1:24:20 PM] ~ Avi: Can anyone tell me about the general engineering branch? I've read we can specialize in a field of our choice after 2 years. Would it be a good choice assuming I've no particular interest
[04/06/25, 1:24:51 PM] Saksham setia: I suppose you will be doing masters further as that branch is in more demand in research
Their IIT Mandi have much more proficiency compared to patna.
If you want more details regarding the program here
@918830761870 might be better for that
[04/06/25, 1:25:04 PM] ~ Tahir: Sorry not too interested in bio
[04/06/25, 1:26:00 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: Dual degrees are dicey imo
After doing btech+mtech if you sit for on campus placements then you will be considered a mtech graduate and usually their placements are lower than btech grads. ‎<This message was edited>

[04/06/25, 1:28:28 PM] ~ Siddhant: For lower branch especially this one, I would suggest Mandi because of the various specializations this branch offers in the third year, along with that it also covers the basic skills u need to acquire which can help in securing placement in most fields

[04/06/25, 1:29:33 PM] Divyansh Jindal: See we can only comment on Mandi since we only know the reality about here. The placements are quite good of Mandi from the data we have. We have an active tech culture with engaging clubs n all and we have frequent hackathons also.
You can base ur decisions based on this

Many new initiatives(inventions too)
[04/06/25, 1:33:45 PM] ~ Arya: Well then you should choose a branch which is not that hectic as it will provide you with time you need to explore other things . In my knowledge Bioengineering is not that hectic.. So IIT MANDI Bioengineering is a good option to consider
[04/06/25, 1:33:50 PM] ~ Fx: hmm but is it better than bombay
[04/06/25, 1:33:50 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: There might be companies who prefer cs and elec majors only but those are quite few
[04/06/25, 1:33:53 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Yea don't be sorry I'm just saying comparing Bombay vs Delhi clubs is useless since no one here has any insider info into them

[04/06/25, 2:10:13 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: Hello everyone! Is IIT Mandi mech better option than IIT Ropar chemical
[04/06/25, 2:10:30 PM] Aryan Garg: Ander ki baat hr college ki yeh hogi ek ki jis bhi college mei jao boys hostel mei toh mza hi aayega 😂
[04/06/25, 2:10:34 PM] Vidisha Thokal: Bhaiya aap bataoge kya ??
[04/06/25, 2:10:35 PM] Sameer Batra: Depends if ur interested in mech or chemical?
[04/06/25, 2:11:02 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: Can develop interest in both but in terms of future opportunities
[04/06/25, 2:11:11 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: Which is better option
[04/06/25, 2:11:11 PM] Aryan Garg: If you have a particular interest then go for your interest both are good options
[04/06/25, 2:11:31 PM] Vitthal Seth: Obv mandi mech, chemical is lighter pr khudke core mei kuchh ni hoga , idhr fallback rhega hi kuchh bhi krna ho toh kr skte side mei
[04/06/25, 2:11:46 PM] Aryan Garg: Better one would be mechanical cause its more of a techy branch
[04/06/25, 2:11:46 PM] Sameer Batra: Both are good if u work hard for ur branch
[04/06/25, 2:12:04 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: Interest is in Electronics, will try to reach there otherwise compromise
[04/06/25, 2:12:24 PM] Aryan Garg: Well then definately mechanical ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 2:13:01 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: Are ropar and mandi equal in terms of opportunities?
[04/06/25, 2:13:23 PM] ~ Arya: Well then you can take chances of branch change too ..Ropar mein hai Mandi mein nhi ...par obv gamble hoga ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 2:13:27 PM] Aryan Garg: Well almost same companies come in both the colleges but Mandi has seen higher packages last year
[04/06/25, 2:13:47 PM] Aryan Garg: Ya if you want to go for branch change then ropar
[04/06/25, 2:13:59 PM] Aryan Garg: Mandi discontinued it last year
[04/06/25, 2:14:08 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: Kinddof. We have good connections with germany too. So opportunities open for foreign too.
[04/06/25, 2:14:21 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: It's not a huge gamble because I got a migraine on advanced day sadly.... Not my actual rank
[04/06/25, 2:15:09 PM] ~ Arya: Ok then..you should go for it ...Rules check kr lena branch change ke ..aur Ropar ke grp mein unke college ke culture ki bhi info lelo
[04/06/25, 2:15:17 PM] Aryan Garg: Well you will just need to maintain a good cgpa for branch change if you are confident you can do it then join ropar group and ask them what it takes to opt for branch change
[04/06/25, 2:15:27 PM] ~ Shivam🧿: See agr tum btech chemical ki baat kr rahe ho tho wo iit mandi mein nahi hai pr... Other iits mein hai jo ki actually ek growing branch with lot of scope hai... And if you want to know about bs chemical then let me know!!!
[04/06/25, 2:15:57 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: Are cllg me padhai krna is diff from ghr me ya abhi kaise padh rhe ho
[04/06/25, 2:16:10 PM] Vitthal Seth: +++++

[04/06/25, 2:16:27 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: But if you determine, then cg lana isnt diff
[04/06/25, 2:16:30 PM] ~ Tahir: Guys I have to choose between nit Trichy materials vs mandi materials , which is a better choice
[04/06/25, 2:16:41 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: I have 13k in mains too
[04/06/25, 2:16:44 PM] Aryan Garg: Every college might treat branch change differently so better ask first in ropar group
[04/06/25, 2:16:53 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: Can get ece in most tier 2 NITs
[04/06/25, 2:16:56 PM] Aryan Garg: Well IIT would be better option
[04/06/25, 2:17:26 PM] ~ Arya: You should still go for IITs
[04/06/25, 2:17:29 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: Since its materials at both places, i would recommend IIT Mandi
[04/06/25, 2:17:51 PM] ~ Aviral Jha: Yeah not planning to slack off....
[04/06/25, 2:18:11 PM] Aryan Garg: Ya its too easy you just need to show just a little interest nothin else nothing compared to jee

[04/06/25, 2:22:25 PM] Aryan Garg: IITs offer way may opportunities and free time to indulge in new skills/projects/hackathons
[04/06/25, 2:22:35 PM] ~ gtaparia52: Which to choose
[04/06/25, 2:22:44 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: Tier 2 IIT OVER NIT any time if the branch is same
[04/06/25, 2:23:17 PM] Aryan Garg: You have any specific interests?
[04/06/25, 2:23:30 PM] ~ Tahir: Alright then
[04/06/25, 2:23:37 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: See placements, both are similar
Opportunities and exposure is better in IITs
Tag of IIT
Foreign opportunites (masters etc)
Research facilities achi h (We even have PARAM supercomputer)
[04/06/25, 2:23:46 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: .
[04/06/25, 2:23:47 PM] ~ Revanth Akkineni: well also about the course in trichy its actually Metallurgy and materials science while at mandi its not that focused on metallurgy so consider that difference too
[04/06/25, 2:24:06 PM] ~ gtaparia52: No
[04/06/25, 2:24:46 PM] ~ Tahir: Yeah that's why preferring mandi
[04/06/25, 2:25:12 PM] ~ Tahir: But travel is also quite an issue right , around 5 hrs to get to Chandigarh
[04/06/25, 2:25:26 PM] Aryan Garg: Ropar EP 
Mandi GE 
are good
[04/06/25, 2:25:35 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: Enjoy the travel dude. Himachal is too beautiful
[04/06/25, 2:25:38 PM] ~ Revanth Akkineni: yeah, its a nice thing to have your college near home and all but again location and travel should only be considered when both the options you have are very similar
[04/06/25, 2:26:10 PM] Aryan Garg: 4 actually 1 from iit to mandi and 3 from mandi to chd

[04/06/25, 2:27:02 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: iit mandi dsai aur cse mein kitna difference hai

Please guide me sir

[04/06/25, 2:28:05 PM] Aryan Garg: Well dsai and cse students do each others courses in free electives so not much of a differenece
Some courses of cse are not included in dse or 2 3 courses shrunk to 1 and in place they have more courses on statistics and AI
Not much difference in packages too almost same ‎<This message was edited>

[04/06/25, 2:30:17 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: We do have good connections with germany and japan. So semester exchanges are also there. You can study in foreign for 1 or 2 sem during yur btech itself
[04/06/25, 2:30:44 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: i am asking as some people were telling that dsai is not recongnized by foreign universities so was confused between bhubhaneshwar cse and mandi dsai as my rank is sandwiched between the cutoffs
[04/06/25, 2:30:52 PM] ~ Tahir: This option is available to any btech or just GE
[04/06/25, 2:31:15 PM] Sachit Bansal: All

[04/06/25, 2:32:49 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: ohh so you need to have a certain cgpa to get single rooms??
[04/06/25, 2:33:19 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Rooms are assigned based on cgpa yes
[04/06/25, 2:33:31 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: No interests then prefer iit

[04/06/25, 2:35:12 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: iit ropar mnc or iit mandi cse/dsai
[04/06/25, 2:35:16 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: ??
[04/06/25, 2:35:26 PM] Arihant Jain: iit mandi cse ofc
[04/06/25, 2:35:38 PM] Divyansh Jindal: IMO mandi cse cuz MNC can be more difficult wrt curriculum
[04/06/25, 2:35:53 PM] Arihant Jain: wait this sounds wrong….mnc at ropar and cse at iit mandi?
[04/06/25, 2:36:00 PM] Saksham setia: I suppose @916387448457 sir best samjha sakte hai

[04/06/25, 2:36:56 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: yeah i mean my rank is 30xx so i may just get mandi cse as last year mandi cse closed at 3118 and iit ropar mnc closed at 3518
[04/06/25, 2:37:02 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Last year yahi tha bhai. Muhhe round 1 me ropar MNC mila tha fir mandi cse milgya
[04/06/25, 2:37:26 PM] Arihant Jain: ohhh got it…..i thought ropar cse and mandi cse is same
[04/06/25, 2:37:28 PM] Divyansh Negi: Ye me iss grp me kaise tag ho raha hu
[04/06/25, 2:37:47 PM] Divyansh Jindal: You'll definitely get mandi cse cuz it'll probably get pushed around 300-400 ranks below due to ropar cse seats doubling
[04/06/25, 2:38:54 PM] Saksham setia: Aapki help chahiye thi guidance me
[04/06/25, 2:39:13 PM] ~ Garv Jain: bhaiya mujhe NIT Tirchy CSE, IIIT Hyderabad CSE and IIT Mandi CSE mei kya lena chahiye

[04/06/25, 2:39:38 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: so is there even the slightest chance of getting ropar AI AS ROPAR AI CLOSED AT 2700 LAST YEAR
[04/06/25, 2:39:57 PM] Aryan Garg: Its not like that floors have common sharing and single rooms both its just that good cg people have a choice if they want to study separately otherwise you have roomies
[04/06/25, 2:39:58 PM] ~ Garv Jain: mujhe kyu tag kiya bhaiya?

[04/06/25, 2:40:44 PM] Arihant Jain: sahi mein😂😂
[04/06/25, 2:40:44 PM] Divyansh Jindal: No idea. There could be since seats in AI have also increased.
[04/06/25, 2:41:31 PM] Aryan Garg: There is a high chance cause seats have increased there and if you are getting that its better come to mandi cse
[04/06/25, 2:41:34 PM] Sachit Bansal: Konsa floor vo bhi btade
[04/06/25, 2:41:36 PM] Divyansh Negi: Tu to na he bol bhai😑

[04/06/25, 2:44:27 PM] Sachit Bansal: Hn because MnC is maths department to maybe a little variation
[04/06/25, 2:45:01 PM] Divyansh Jindal: MNC KA thora different rehta h. Its like 75% math and 25% cse
[04/06/25, 2:45:14 PM] ~ Garv Jain: mujhe jo mock me milatha vahi real me bhi is liye bola tha. None the less you know better

[04/06/25, 2:46:29 PM] Aryan Garg: Like 2 3 companies prefer cse only 
Rest some go for dse ee then mnc too but mostly all companies are open
[04/06/25, 2:46:38 PM] Arihant Jain: ofc i know better😂
[04/06/25, 2:47:09 PM] Divyansh Jindal: If ur getting cse and dsai in the same college go for cse.
[04/06/25, 2:47:24 PM] Aryan Garg: Its not like that when i say 2 3 i am not talking about any major companies some mid companies do such thing
[04/06/25, 2:47:37 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: agar different collee mein hai toh?
[04/06/25, 2:47:46 PM] Aryan Garg: Toh dsai
[04/06/25, 2:47:50 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Ropar dsai vs mandi cse?

[04/06/25, 2:48:18 PM] Aryan Garg: Mandi CSE
[04/06/25, 2:48:58 PM] Sameer Batra: prefer mandi cse
[04/06/25, 2:49:07 PM] Aryan Garg: Ropar AI is a new branch and no placement records and also their cutoff last year was high due to lesser no. of seats and some people think mandi is isolated no other reason
[04/06/25, 2:49:18 PM] Sameer Batra: cuz same companies aati h dono college mein ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 2:49:35 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: ok patna cse  aur jodhpur cse aur mandi cse almost same hai kya cuz unka rank cutoff bhi same hai??
[04/06/25, 2:49:38 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Uh see I took CSE over dsai in ropar since according to my seniors from other colleges, AI is a specialisation. It's not guaranteed that specialisation will be better than the general
[04/06/25, 2:50:09 PM] Arihant Jain: yup even i took mandi cse over ropar cse due to placements
[04/06/25, 2:50:50 PM] Divyansh Jindal: All of them are similar in a way.
[04/06/25, 2:51:11 PM] ~ Garv Jain: take ai if it is in a decently better cllg otherwise go for cse as more options
[04/06/25, 2:51:15 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Its better if you find the pros and cons of each and then decide urself
[04/06/25, 2:51:25 PM] Aryan Garg: Dont judge any branch based of cutoffs always check placements too
Cutoffs for lower branches in gen 1 IITs is also high in some cases tho there are obv better options in higher branches in gen 2 ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 2:51:48 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: also does location of college matter like mandi is in a secluded hilly area so do companies not prefer to go there should i focus on taking  some college in a city??
[04/06/25, 2:51:48 PM] Sameer Batra: & course structure
[04/06/25, 2:52:02 PM] Sameer Batra: nope
[04/06/25, 2:52:05 PM] Sameer Batra: not at all
[04/06/25, 2:52:28 PM] Divyansh Jindal: It doesn't matter here. Strong placement cell + gen 2 iit companies will come if they get skilled people
[04/06/25, 2:52:42 PM] Aryan Garg: No ropar being in plains and mandi in hills still same companies come and still better placements in mandi ‎<This message was edited>

[04/06/25, 2:57:08 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: just a random question i noticed 2023 cutoffs for gen 2 iits cse in 2023 they were about 2500-2700 but in 2024 they were aound 3100?
[04/06/25, 2:57:12 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: why is this drop
[04/06/25, 2:57:23 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: is this because of an increase in seats
[04/06/25, 2:57:30 PM] Dushyant: Increase in seats
[04/06/25, 2:57:31 PM] Sameer Batra: seats were increased in gen 1 iits

[04/06/25, 2:58:57 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: is there ANY increase in seats this year is there any chance of cutoffs goinf 100-200 ranks below
[04/06/25, 2:58:58 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: \?/
[04/06/25, 2:59:23 PM] Divyansh Jindal: It is in Ropar, so I think cse will go around 300-400 ranks lower
[04/06/25, 2:59:36 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: so like 330?
[04/06/25, 2:59:41 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: 3300
[04/06/25, 2:59:44 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: ??
[04/06/25, 3:00:08 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Probably more like 3400-3500 I think
[04/06/25, 3:00:18 PM] Divyansh Jindal: This is just a speculation btw ^ ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 3:01:15 PM] ~ Kavish Grover: I have crl 38xx, how is AI and DS in Mandi?
[04/06/25, 3:01:18 PM] Aryan Garg: Well i don't think so 
Mandi had great packages compared to other IITs so probably Mandi cutoff (keeping in mind packages and increased seats) could remain same, as students go for packages
[04/06/25, 3:01:40 PM] Aryan Garg: Best in that range ...
[04/06/25, 3:01:48 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Yea again it could go on any side. Everything is just speculation we will truly only know when the mock 1 results come
[04/06/25, 3:02:04 PM] Saksham setia: I would say if it's even 1k above your rank should at least fill that
You never know what might happen as at the end it depends on the choice filling of students
[04/06/25, 3:03:06 PM] ~ Kavish Grover: Yes but like my other options are mech in Roorkee, EE at BHU/Indore, or CSE at Dhanbad so compared to them
[04/06/25, 3:03:20 PM] Aryan Garg: I filled IIT Bombay CSE too even tho i knew i wouldn't get it 
It never hurts to ask for more 
Add any number of branches and colleges but make sure the ones where you can actually get that choice you should fill choices near it carefully
[04/06/25, 3:03:35 PM] Divyansh Jindal: I think everyone did that lol
[04/06/25, 3:03:36 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: you most likely may not get ee at bhu
[04/06/25, 3:03:57 PM] Aryan Garg: I had 35XX rank and am currently in DSAI 
No regrets and won't in future too
[04/06/25, 3:04:41 PM] ~ Kavish Grover: Haan vaise 200 ka diff hai maybe I have a chance
[04/06/25, 3:05:24 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: actually last year iit ke har branch ke cutoff thode se gir gaye the isliye thoda conservative leke chal
[04/06/25, 3:05:39 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: pata nahin shayad seat increase hue hai shayad
[04/06/25, 3:05:58 PM] ~ Kavish Grover: Haan shayad top 7 me hue hai to benefit to hume bhi hoga
[04/06/25, 3:06:26 PM] Aryan Garg: Still don't expect the cutoffs to change too much until the seats in a particular branch have doubled or so
[04/06/25, 3:06:32 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: if i take iit Kharagpur mechanical will i get to sit in fang?
[04/06/25, 3:06:45 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Vo to unko pucho

[04/06/25, 3:10:50 PM] Aryan Garg: Well it is 2nd gen but still considered in tier 3 by some
Tier and gen are different ... ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 3:12:03 PM] ~ Mdkaif: Rorkee ki machanical best h ya ropar ki mnc ?
[04/06/25, 3:12:20 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: so agar by chance i just missout mandi cse /patna cse/jodhpur cse should i go bhubhaneshwar cse(3600 closing) or mandi/patna dsai????
[04/06/25, 3:12:33 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: my rank is 30xx
[04/06/25, 3:13:30 PM] Aryan Garg: In my opinion DsAI is better option then cause packages are same, there is hardly any difference
Only if you are missing CSE ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 3:13:31 PM] Divyansh Jindal: I mean you will 99.99% not miss out on mandi cse, but after that I would recommend dsai

[04/06/25, 3:14:56 PM] ~ زید صدیقی: Hello Bhaiya can I DM you please?
[04/06/25, 3:15:19 PM] Aryan Garg: A very very slim chance due to increased seats in other colleges but still fill other options below it carefully cause you may miss it
[04/06/25, 3:15:22 PM] Aryan Garg: Yes
[04/06/25, 3:15:37 PM] ~ Anjani Koumudh: Ok
[04/06/25, 3:17:03 PM] Divyansh Jindal: imo, most probably this time yes. But not confirmed since last year the cutoff was around 31xx ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 3:17:49 PM] Aryan Garg: Not most probably it like probably.... 30 percent chance until all fill based on placements and not previous data
[04/06/25, 3:18:05 PM] Divyansh Jindal: ok bhaiya
[04/06/25, 3:18:52 PM] ~ Mdkaif: ??
[04/06/25, 3:20:07 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: mere hisaab se mechanical mat le agar job software mein karne wala hai future mein agar college mein cse/cse allied lega toh core subject skills ache se develop hongi
[04/06/25, 3:20:16 PM] Aryan Garg: If you have specific interest in some definately choose that otherwise ropar's mnc has better placement last year i think
Also read there curriculum
[04/06/25, 3:20:47 PM] ~ Mdkaif: Ok
[04/06/25, 3:21:11 PM] ~ Vishesh Singh: I have a question 
If i registered for csab after josaa counselling for nits
Will i sacrifice the josaa seat for csab or is it still available if i dont get the preferred branch in csab?
And end up loosing everything??
[04/06/25, 3:21:30 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: no jossa seat sacrifice nahin hogi

[04/06/25, 4:59:43 PM] ~ Anakhveer: Placement
[04/06/25, 5:00:56 PM] Aryan Garg: Well IITs sure are better they provide you many opportunities you can get jobs both on campus and off campus based on your projects and hackathons, which you would do more in an IIT

[04/06/25, 5:01:05 PM] Yash Sharma: We don't have the data for mnc as there is not a passed out batch but it's packages should be well enough and comparable to nit surathkal cse ig

[04/06/25, 5:17:01 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: So a junior
[04/06/25, 5:17:05 PM] Pranshu Gupta: Since our branch is relatively new with only two batches so far, we don't have an established placement record yet. However, there are plenty of opportunities ahead—both in core sectors like PSUs, ISRO, and DRDO, as well as in non-core areas. You’ll also have strong prospects for pursuing higher studies. The coursework allows enough time for skill development, whether it's coding or other interests. Moreover, many companies participate in open umbrella placements, giving you the flexibility to apply and interview with a wide range of them.

[04/06/25, 5:21:34 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Honestly single room in 1st year seems like a bane than a boon. You're supposed to interact with people and that's just not possible in a single room.

[04/06/25, 5:22:23 PM] ~ Revanth Akkineni: I dont think you can do mtech again but most dual degrees should have an option to go out with only a btech degree after 4 years

[04/06/25, 6:42:34 PM] ~ Arya: In this case other factors come into play .. Like location of your home .. Do you prefer being near to a city or not Because DS AI in IIT MANDI is totally comparable to both of them

Campus acha h

[04/06/25, 8:26:26 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: It also has a great faculty and networking ecosystem setup
[04/06/25, 8:27:17 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: hm but can i break into tech jobs with bioengineering tho
[04/06/25, 8:28:04 PM] ~ :): What if someone took cs in 12 th
[04/06/25, 8:29:32 PM] Devansh Popli: Yeah the curriculum is relatively chill....you will get plenty of time to develop tech related skills and break into tech jobs
[04/06/25, 8:29:56 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: That was the case with me too
I didn't face any difficulty in my whole first year.
And as far as I have interacted with my seniors the whole bio course is very chill and you get plenty of time to work on your skills and prepare for tech roles.
[04/06/25, 8:30:15 PM] Devansh Popli: Maximum number of students are placed in tech jobs only
[04/06/25, 8:30:58 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: okay cool
[04/06/25, 8:31:04 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: how bad is the accessibility issue in mandi?
[04/06/25, 8:31:20 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: people in other groups told me to avoid mandi altogether because of location
[04/06/25, 8:31:50 PM] Sameer Batra: It is just being over-exaggerated
[04/06/25, 8:32:11 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: A flight or a train from any place to Chandigarh/delhi
Then a bus to mandi
[04/06/25, 8:32:23 PM] ~ Arya: ‎This message was deleted.
[04/06/25, 8:32:37 PM] ~ Arya: A 40 min bus ride can get you from IIT to Mandi city
[04/06/25, 8:33:27 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: iit mandi mein khana kaisa hai??
[04/06/25, 8:33:35 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: especially lunch
[04/06/25, 8:33:44 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: Mere expectations se tho accha hi tha
[04/06/25, 8:34:05 PM] ~ Arya: Agar tum phele se ghar ke bahar ho ..toh obv khaana kaafi accha hai relatively
[04/06/25, 8:34:17 PM] Devansh Popli: Food is good....just don't set your expectations too high
[04/06/25, 8:34:29 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: ++
[04/06/25, 8:34:53 PM] Vidhi Chandak: But quite good than what is generally expected in mess
[04/06/25, 8:34:56 PM] ~ Tahir: So the core students just get a lower placement for a tech job or the stats for core placements includes only core jobs?
[04/06/25, 8:34:57 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: I am saying this for ig 5th time
People outside think this is a remote village. No its not.
Its an institute of national importance.
All facilities are available. Some even say that there are no medical facilities. Please ignore them. 
All the facilities are available. Anything you want gets delivered in two days. 
So please dont be in any such misconception. 
I have not faced any single issue throughout my first year
[04/06/25, 8:35:07 PM] ~ Arya: Bhai agar ghar se bahar rhe ho toh  pta chal jaata hai ki expectations waise hi nhi rkhni chahiye
[04/06/25, 8:36:16 PM] ~ Arya: Core companies bioengineering ke placement ke liye aati hi kam hai
[04/06/25, 8:36:19 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: how is raggi g at iit mandi
[04/06/25, 8:36:25 PM] Devansh Popli: Noo stats include both jobs in core and tech related fields as weell
[04/06/25, 8:36:46 PM] ~ Tahir: Hmm then why is it much lower on avg?
[04/06/25, 8:37:02 PM] Dushyant: Non existant
[04/06/25, 8:37:09 PM] ~ Arya: Well isko leke admin kaafi strict hai ...So ragging toh nhi hi hogi
[04/06/25, 8:37:27 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: i get the frustration im sorry 😭 just very confused, thanks a lot for making it clear
[04/06/25, 8:37:34 PM] Devansh Popli: Actually if you want to go in core for bioengineering, it's better to do a M.S. or Mtech degree after btech
[04/06/25, 8:37:41 PM] Aryan Garg: Oh oh i was thinking now who is raggi 😂🤣
[04/06/25, 8:37:44 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: Tum chahoge to bhi mushkil h🫠
[04/06/25, 8:37:51 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: if I take dsai toh software companies ke alawa koi dusra companies hote hain kya placement ke liye??
[04/06/25, 8:38:13 PM] Aryan Garg: Yes
[04/06/25, 8:38:28 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: consulting??
[04/06/25, 8:38:43 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: Most IITs are also at the outskirts of Cities.. take Patna as an example..40Kms away, They might say about location, but we have a properly Connected to the City.. we have Institute Bus regularly Scheduled, You will find all your Day-to-day use items in Supermarket which is in campus only.. also we have Vendor Shops inside the campus.. you won't face any difficulty here
[04/06/25, 8:39:15 PM] ~ Vikrant Singh: Finance.. as Data Analysts
[04/06/25, 8:39:17 PM] Saksham setia: Aesa schene hai Seniors ragging lene se darte hai
[04/06/25, 8:39:37 PM] Aryan Garg: Well you will be good in data analysis so ya
[04/06/25, 8:40:59 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: iit mandi mein maggi sabse zyada high selling hai kya canteen mein?
[04/06/25, 8:41:21 PM] Aryan Garg: Well not sbse zyada.... in canteens
[04/06/25, 8:41:21 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: cuz of hilly region
[04/06/25, 8:41:34 PM] Aryan Garg: Well people buy and make it in their hostels with friends
[04/06/25, 8:41:38 PM] Saksham setia: Bhai canteen se kyo lenge
Khud bnana beneficial hai
[04/06/25, 8:41:39 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: But yes if you have lived in a metro city like Bombay/delhi
Then you might miss that city Life after some time ;)
[04/06/25, 8:41:39 PM] Aryan Garg: As it is cheaper
[04/06/25, 8:42:08 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: is electric tove allowed in hostel??
[04/06/25, 8:42:16 PM] Aryan Garg: Not your personal
[04/06/25, 8:42:27 PM] Aryan Garg: One is provided in each hostel
[04/06/25, 8:42:46 PM] Aryan Garg: You just need to bring your own utensils ofcourse
[04/06/25, 8:42:53 PM] Dushyant: Try to consider this 
Alot of people live near the region
There are people who often visit the place due to its location and calm wether aur agar itna bada Institute yaha ban sakta hai toh sari facilities bhi aa sakti and also consider this approx 3500 people mograte to iit mandi every year especially aproxx 2000 of btech itself so how is connectivity and assiblity is a problem i dont see
Jitna patna assesible hai utna hi iit mandi
 ~Aur rather patna ka kya bole woh toh bihar hai~
[04/06/25, 8:42:53 PM] Saksham setia: You can issue induction in hostels
But you will need to bring your own pan
[04/06/25, 8:42:55 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: yeah, how do people get over that
[04/06/25, 8:43:23 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: last line 😭 okay fine ty
[04/06/25, 8:43:57 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: a random question is this group an official group that iits ask seniors to make every year?
[04/06/25, 8:44:05 PM] Dushyant: By going on trips 
Yk himachal pradesh has tourist spot aint it?
[04/06/25, 8:44:11 PM] Harshit Jain: Yes. Nothing is asked by the administration though. It's the Student community that makes these groups ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 8:44:26 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: fair enough
[04/06/25, 8:44:38 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: You have a lot to explore... charo taraf pahaad h. Trekk... pass me shimla manali etc h. Itni to jgh h ghumne trekking and friends k sath masti k liye
[04/06/25, 8:44:41 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: I went home whenever I got holidays greater than 5 days 
But chandigarh is quite near and lots of things to do there, plus many places like manali/shimla just feel like heaven
[04/06/25, 8:45:18 PM] Saksham setia: Just an advice 
Please don't try making any unofficial freshers group
[04/06/25, 8:45:21 PM] ~ Tahir: How often ?
[04/06/25, 8:45:26 PM] Aryan Garg: IITs didn't ask seniors precisely that thing happens later for induction and other help when you are about to join. This is made by seniors by taking their permission. ‎<This message was edited>

[04/06/25, 8:45:59 PM] ~ Tahir: Oh ok then
[04/06/25, 8:46:12 PM] ~ Tahir: Yeah same i think it's like 12 k round trip
[04/06/25, 8:46:38 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: Banglore to Delhi have  enough flights so if you plan accordingly that would avoid extra costs ‎<This message was edited>
[04/06/25, 8:46:55 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: how long are the vacations
[04/06/25, 8:46:56 PM] Dushyant: You need to travel like 4 times a year so cost isnt a factor ig

its so hard to decide top iit with lower branch or mandi with mech
[04/06/25, 8:48:20 PM] ~ inferno 25': due to campus and location
[04/06/25, 8:48:39 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: toh iss samay ghar par jaana compulsory hota ki hostel mein ruk sakte hain
[04/06/25, 8:48:47 PM] Dushyant: To avoid costs tou can opt for buses which are rather cheap yet luxurious
[04/06/25, 8:49:09 PM] ~ inferno 25': banglore to delhi by bus?😭
[04/06/25, 8:49:14 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Ruk skte ho bs extra paisa lgta h

Round trip flights from Delhi cost me around 7.5k then buses I manage in another 1k(if you book near dates)

[04/06/25, 9:03:37 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: instead of some top iit core branch
[04/06/25, 9:03:38 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: For bio
[04/06/25, 9:03:48 PM] ~ Mayank Tiwari: Is iit goa mechanical better than iit mandi materials/bioengineering?
[04/06/25, 9:04:02 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: Bad compared to what?
[04/06/25, 9:04:12 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: fair

[04/06/25, 9:04:47 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: if the highest is 13.25Lpa then thats a lil less right
[04/06/25, 9:05:12 PM] ~ Mayank Tiwari: I think mechanical is better but college life of mandi/jodhpur would be better than goa...
[04/06/25, 9:05:44 PM] ~ Arya: Again if you think you can go with both of them at once ..take mech
[04/06/25, 9:06:09 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: See like most of the years in mandi's placement bio has performed among the top4 
It's just that last year many preferred higher studies over sitting in placements.
[04/06/25, 9:06:19 PM] Devansh Popli: Maybe ,would just like to mention Bio had nearly 100% placement for 3-4 years before the recession period
[04/06/25, 9:06:37 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: And this year almost all branches got hit by recession
[04/06/25, 9:06:45 PM] ~ Gauravi Tiwari 🎋: okay makes sense

[04/06/25, 9:14:26 PM] Aryan Garg: Well i wrote it and then used AI to refine..

[04/06/25, 9:17:38 PM] ~ Arya: And Gandhinagar ranks higher than mandi
[04/06/25, 9:17:52 PM] ~ Manas: ohh
[04/06/25, 9:18:07 PM] ~ Arya: So Gandhinagar is a better choice ...if you are getting lower branches in both of them
[04/06/25, 9:18:16 PM] Devansh Popli: Yess but ig mandi has a better placement record than gandhinagar for lower branches
[04/06/25, 9:18:37 PM] ~ Shreyans Bhalgat: but why aren't Gandhinagar placements that high even thugh cse closes at 1.7k there?

[04/06/25, 9:19:33 PM] ~ Manas: So, less competition at mandi as compared to gandhinagar is that it?
[04/06/25, 9:19:48 PM] Utkarsh Ranjan: More or less yes
[04/06/25, 9:20:10 PM] ~ Arya: But better opportunities in Gandhinagar

[04/06/25, 11:26:47 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Choosing Mandi ee would be a safer choice as you get a good core branch and it has good scope ahead. Definitely roorkee would provide you more exposure but it's just that if you want good placement then probably you will have to do something else side by side along chemical or like go for MBA and all, if you don't want to pursue chemical ahead.

Even if tum apna puri edi choti ka dum laga lo fir bhi bht kum chances hai ki hoga so drop that point(its simply unreliable because tumhe nahi pata tumhara competitionkya hoga clg me ) 
So agar overall flexible field chaiye toh mandi mech would be my preference 
(Inside info: branch change ke liye bht padhai karni hoti hai so if you are going for that be ready)
[05/06/25, 9:01:18 AM] Pranshu Gupta: Material Science at IIT Mandi is quite strong, offering multiple opportunities in both the private and government sectors. Additionally, there are excellent prospects for pursuing advanced research and higher studies.

Don't stress too much about placements just think about what potential the branch can have in the future. Vaise bhi placements end mai individual par bhi depend karti hai.

If you want more rigorous statistical/probabilistic aspects and exploring the nitty gritty of data and its applications then go for DSAI

I highly prefer you to opt for IIT Mandi DSAI from the options you mentioned... as it is not a new branch, is well developed, unlike some of the others you mentioned
[05/06/25, 11:09:49 AM] Aryan Garg: And since you are good in maths too it will highly help in statistics and data analysis
[05/06/25, 11:11:00 AM] ~ 🗿: I heard from some seniors that dsai at undergraduate level isn't that good, and would require a master's degree for specialisation, and that core cse might be better at ug as it is more flexible, I'm not sure about it... ‎<This message was edited>

[05/06/25, 11:16:12 AM] Sameer Batra: Yes! The branch is oriented towards maths a little but also offers courses which are designed to help you in future!
[05/06/25, 11:16:39 AM] Sameer Batra: Prefer Mandi dsai/mnc on top according to your interests
[05/06/25, 11:16:57 AM] ~ 🗿: Yes, I've heard that mnc is generally more of mathematics and less of computing, and might be on a tougher side
[05/06/25, 11:17:04 AM] Aryan Garg: Well that depends you are more inclined towards maths or want to for a coding and AI based job
[05/06/25, 11:17:35 AM] Sameer Batra: It's around 55-60% maths afaik

[05/06/25, 2:41:22 PM] Saatvik: Yourself
[05/06/25, 2:42:15 PM] Utkarsh Doosra: See
Mandi ka placement acha h, cnp cell jaafi strong h.
Internship k liye microsoft, google, adobe and amazon vi le jate h. Placement bhi
Clubs, cultural technical dono active h. Humare liye in clubs ne kaafi sessions liye h. 
Hackathons and competitions ache hote h.
Remote location ka factor kabhi relevant nhi rha. Sab kuch available h. Har ek facility h
Proffs for cse are quite good. Specially the HOD is very good.
Campus boht sunder h. State bhi himachal h (so no terrorism or chori aur loot iykyk)
Research facilities achi h. We even have supercomputer PARAM. Dekh lena kis kis IIT k pass h.
Semester exchange program bhi available h. You can go and study abroad for a couple of sems in Germany, Japan or even Norway.
TU Munich se tie up h.
Aur koi doubt ho to puch lo.
Ye ups merko yaad aye h abhi. Maybe kuch ups mai bhul gya hu.

Downs me ye hai ki city life nhi milegi. Jo boht si iits jo city me h wha bhi nhi hoti. IIT Indore bhi city se boht dur hi h. Personal exp. Also, the weather and scene tumhe city life yaad krne ka time hi nhi dega. Trekks and all friends k sath jaa skte ho, which shall build way better memories than going to malls with friends.
Baaki upto you. Good luck🙂

[05/06/25, 2:51:56 PM] Saatvik: More downs:
- Current administration leaves a lot to be desired
- There will be a few facilities that are missing such as some specific medical facilities, movie theatres etc 
- Rain and other rare events can cause power and water outage
- Faculties vary wildly on a spectrum of "I hate this person" to "yo didn't know you were chill like that"

Check curriculum for both and decide which you want
[05/06/25, 3:02:04 PM] Harshit Jain: If you want to know about the student exchange program you'll have to contact someone from kgp.
Other than that you can obviously do masters from usa and I am sure  iit kgp must have a nice alumni network pursuing the same path. You may contact them

Btw my father is suggesting to take civil but I don't really know which one would be best in long term

[06/06/25, 12:42:43 AM] ~ Shivam🧿: If you are talking between iit jodhpur bs chemistry and iit mandi bs chemical... Choose iit mandi because this branch is research oriented and iit mandi holds a good position in the research area...

The only +1 in iit jodhpur is that branch change is possible...

But if you are talking between iit jodhpur Chemical eng. and iit mandi bs chemical obviously go for chemical eng...

[06/06/25, 10:44:03 AM] Ujjwal Singh: Between Ropar ee and IIT Mandi ee/vlsi ,there is not much difference as in terms of placement stats as of earlier years but what I know surely about my IIT is that in Mandi the tech culture is really increasing a lot ,the clubs are very active there's ton of hackathons(seriously lots of them that are given by companies of inter IIT),seniors help a lot ,we have new courses which are not in others especially in 1st and 2nd year that are FDP(in case you take ee) ,DP for all,3 data science courses for all,ML and DL courses that you can take and this is till now we know you can take courses like intelligent systems/control systems a lot more over these 4 years.
One more thing like I also had a confusion between Ropar and Mandi I found out that according to their senior who got the highest package in 2024 he told me that acad at Ropar is very hectic and a lot of stuff is not useful unlike IIIT H where acad is hectic but the courses are very good and they benefit in future so don't think of it that way.You should not compare by placement stats only coz those are just initial they don't determine your career as such you should also think that these 4 years won't be repeated and think where you can explore new stuff at the same time enjoy yourself as well coz I always say you realize how good Mandi is after you reach home .

[06/06/25, 11:01:43 AM] ~ Saashi Gupta: Guys I have a question. Until yesterday I was filling Mandi just after Indore.. but now after taking into account the placement data and general opinion, it’s going after patna….
I need @seniors unbiased opinion in this matter now…. For mech engg btw
[06/06/25, 11:02:54 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Can I know what "general opinion"?
[06/06/25, 11:04:57 AM] ~ Keshav: +1
Baki college placement stats clearly nhi bata rhi 
Par mandi k stats dekhkar to IIIT kota better lag rha h
Ab kya join karu
[06/06/25, 11:05:31 AM] ~ Saashi Gupta: general opinion as in word on the street… i am really really confused now… was so ready for mandi mech but..
[06/06/25, 11:05:47 AM] Dushyant: Tumhari placements ko abhi bhi 4 to 5 yrs hai trends can change 
Like india me chip manufacturing and production ke karn vlsi walo ki placements bhi high ho sakti hai 
Trends might change dont bet on placement stats
[06/06/25, 11:07:00 AM] Divyansh Jindal: are I mean, like people say accessibility ka issue hai, which isn't a real thing on ground level. baaki aur kya cheeze hai jo tume lgti hai.
see we can only clarify any things you might have been told, whether they are correct or not.
[06/06/25, 11:07:32 AM] Ujjwal Singh: See there's a reason why other aren't showing and you don't have to worry the placement will get back to where there were like in 19-23 and better ,2025 was better than 2024 so it is going up now and all colleges had bad 2024
[06/06/25, 11:07:34 AM] ~ Saashi Gupta: Accessibility is not an issue bhaiya. I toh preferred mandi over others.
[06/06/25, 11:07:48 AM] Vidisha Thokal: So would you really trust the colleges which do not show their placement stats clearly?
[06/06/25, 11:07:58 AM] Dushyant: Genrally IIITs ka campus bhi nahi hota and they have limmited no. Of departments 
IITs have a better exposure compared to IIIT and culture wise bhi(almost everything from coding to clubs) so Between IIT and IIIT always chose IIT
[06/06/25, 11:08:26 AM] Pranab Pandey: Don't choose a college due to its placement stats choose it because of its opportunity. Every IIT will provide you good companies. It depends on you whether you will take that or not
[06/06/25, 11:08:38 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Yea so just basing the stuff on "log yeh sochte hai" isn't a good decision imo. I would recommend you look at the facts and the pros and the cons and then decide baed on that
[06/06/25, 11:09:15 AM] Pranab Pandey: Plus we have been pretty good at research and all
[06/06/25, 11:09:41 AM] ~ Saashi Gupta: What pros and cons? I don’t know where to find this kind of info… eg: im trying to decide between ropar and mandi… ppl of either college are biased .. that leaves me more confused
[06/06/25, 11:10:20 AM] ~ Keshav: Past year records include the students like me and even better than me
If 75%  of them are choosing something else or are not getting placed, i can't believe it is good
[06/06/25, 11:11:39 AM] Pranab Pandey: No it depends on your skills how you grab those opportunities provided by the college. companies ultimately look for people with good skills. If you know an outdated technology how can you expect a company to hire you ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 11:13:12 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Ask the positives and negatives of each college to their respective seniors. I'll tell you of Mandi
Pros
- We have a good tech culture with multiple hackathons (trust me on this one), and very active clubs who regularly host events and contests
- Great fests with our last year's techfest budget being 50L+, and amazing cult and sports fests as well.
- The faculty is quite helpful and supporting and some of us have even done research projects in our 1st year under them

Cons
- can't think of any lmao. if anyone else can please share
[06/06/25, 11:14:23 AM] Pranab Pandey: And placement is not always the goal as our respected director sir said you goal should be trying to innovate the things. If you have those skills you will get hired even in private college. The only difference is IITs will provide you with World class opportunities to develop those skills
[06/06/25, 11:14:24 AM] ~ Keshav: Cons: Placement percentage
[06/06/25, 11:14:45 AM] ~ Saashi Gupta: Dude chill.., there r more imp things
[06/06/25, 11:15:14 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Ur not wrong but I don't think the placement of 2025 batch is over yet. I don't even know where that data is from
[06/06/25, 11:15:35 AM] ~ Aayush: dude if you see the percentage for Mandi  is calculated against total no. of students in the batch, whereas other iits main its calculated against students who sat for placements
[06/06/25, 11:16:02 AM] ~ Keshav: Mere ghar wale sirf placement k liye hi iit bhej rhe h
Agar unko bol du ki placement achi nhi h to pvt tier 10 college me kara denge
[06/06/25, 11:16:05 AM] Sameer Batra: Yess, the data of this year is incomplete
[06/06/25, 11:16:20 AM] Divyansh Jindal: Arre haan yeh cheez nhi dekhi
[06/06/25, 11:16:39 AM] ~ Aayush: ofc skewed aayega jab unhone pura batch ho count nhi kra toh zyada show krega
[06/06/25, 11:17:42 AM] ~ Aayush: agar batch size 150 hai aur baithe 75 hai placements ke liye.... , toh mandi par 150 and baaki iits ka 75 mai se placement percentage nikala hai
[06/06/25, 11:18:10 AM] ~ Aayush: and why are we even debating on placement percentage guys 😭
[06/06/25, 11:18:15 AM] Priyansh Saha: and not everyone sits for placements, some go for higher studies / research projects
[06/06/25, 11:18:42 AM] Priyansh Saha: real
[06/06/25, 11:19:23 AM] ~ Aayush: exactly agar mujhe place hi hona hota toh voh  mass recruiter hi krdega 😂
[06/06/25, 11:19:37 AM] ~ Keshav: Are ye chhodo

[06/06/25, 11:20:27 AM] ~ Keshav: Total students kam thodi ho jayenge agar chal rhi h to

[06/06/25, 11:22:38 AM] ~ Surya: placements don't happen based solely on your jee rank and what you accomplished 4 yrs ago. they happen based on what you learnt, gained and experienced over the course of 4 yrs. many ppl get lost or distracted in these 4 yrs and many finally pave the track on which they'll walk for the rest of their lives. also judging any college and branch just by their placements is not a very good metric, there are lots of factors like environment and growth opportunities. ppl prosper when they get a kind of environment suited to them and not necessarily but in general iits have it better than other colleges. the rest is upto you, each college will be biased towards their own, ask questions related to the opportunities available here, not to ask "this vs this", you guys are sensible enough to judge that yourselves.

Also instead of placements in our opinion, you should look at the curriculum of the branch ur taking and compare it. Its a better indication than placement

[06/06/25, 12:22:00 PM] Sameer Batra: *For all those confused between IIT Mandi MnC and IIT Ropar MnC*

i just checked curriculum for IIT Ropar Mnc and compared it with IIT Mandi Mnc and found a few interesting points:

1. Mandi has a lot more free electives credits than ropar in the course which you can choose according to your liking.
2. ⁠Ropar’s curriculum has lot more generic and non-core courses like geography and environmental science even till their sixth semester which, honestly, prove out to be useless. On the other hand, Mandi’s curriculum offers more branch specific courses from 1st year itself which are more industry-oriented. 
3. Important ⁠Courses like Machine Learning and Data Structures are offered in the initial years of study contrary to Ropar where these courses are offered in 3rd year of Study.

Consider these points before making any choice if academics and placements matter to you.

[06/06/25, 1:10:49 PM] Aryan Garg: I think this AI response covers many things.....

Here’s a breakdown to help you decide between IIT Mandi Bio, IIT BHU Pharmaceutical, and IIT Patna Civil, based on career scope, campus, flexibility, and interests:


---

🔬 1. IIT Mandi – Bioengineering

Pros:

Upcoming interdisciplinary field (bio + tech).

Mandi is improving rapidly; good infrastructure and exposure.

Research-focused institute; decent global opportunities.

Coding electives are possible (especially in 2nd year onwards).


Cons:

Less core jobs in India currently.

You’ll need to switch to coding or go abroad for better placements if not interested in biotech core.


Best for: Someone open to research, coding, or switching to interdisciplinary tech (bioinformatics, AI in healthcare).



---

💊 2. IIT BHU – Pharmaceutical Engineering

Pros:

Old, reputed IIT; very good alumni network.

Option to shift career paths via coding or analytics if needed.

Strong in pharma core (good for MS/PhD or jobs like DRDO, pharma companies).


Cons:

Limited core jobs unless you aim for pharma R&D or higher studies.

Heavy chemistry/chemical engineering base—can be dry if you're not interested.


Best for: Students open to either core pharma or using IIT BHU’s reputation to pivot (coding, MBA, UPSC, etc.).



---

🏗️ 3. IIT Patna – Civil Engineering

Pros:

Core jobs in PSUs, infrastructure firms.

IIT Patna has decent placement growth, though not elite yet.

Civil is relatively stable and known in India.


Cons:

Less flexibility in shifting to coding unless you put in extra effort.

Core civil jobs may have lower pay unless it’s PSU.


Best for: Someone okay with core engineering or PSU goal, or ready to work hard to switch fields.



---

✅ Priority Order Based on General Flexibility + Career Scope (and if you are not into core)

> 1. IIT Mandi Bio (more flexible; better coding and research options)
2. IIT BHU Pharma (older IIT, good brand, can switch with effort)
3. IIT Patna Civil (least flexible unless you're PSU/core-focused)




---

🧠 Final Advice:

If you're interested in tech/coding, prefer Mandi Bio (more flexibility and better environment for coding).

If you want brand + options for MBA/Govt/PhD, BHU Pharma is solid.

If you're okay with Civil/PSU or will do coding on the side rigorously, Patna Civil is fine.


Let me know your interests (coding, core, UPSC, abroad, etc.), and I can personalize it more!
[06/06/25, 1:13:03 PM] ~ PRIYANSHU: ee at kgp/Roorkee or ee at iit Hyderabad or eee at iit guhawati
[06/06/25, 1:13:56 PM] Aryan Garg: Well actually comparing like this doesn't seem right 

Cause branches effect a lot if you want to rank like this do it for particular branch as it may be possible higher branches in Mandi have better packages while lower branches in Patna

IIT bhu ke seniors bol rhe agar lower branch le hi rhe toh better college prefer karo
And iit mandi ke seniors bol rhe bhu kaafi crowded h isliye kaafi jyada competitive ho jayega and mandi bio meh tech job ke liye extra time bhi kaafi milega
What’s better

[06/06/25, 2:45:40 PM] Sachit Bansal: GE has good level courses. Considering specialisations. Means you will do good level courses ofc. 

That too 
Communication- Core field of electrical courses
Fintech - core maths courses
Robo and Ai btane ki need ni hai. You get the idea
Mechatroncis is again mecha plus electro

[06/06/25, 2:48:21 PM] Aryan Garg: No particular interests
[06/06/25, 2:48:36 PM] Sameer Batra: Baaki agar tech mein jana h toh I think mnc hi better rhega

[06/06/25, 2:55:03 PM] Sameer Batra: but iiit ko cancel krdo
[06/06/25, 2:55:11 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Bhai agar interest nahi hai toh ee bhi dhek sakta hai tech mei jaa hi sakta hai then core bhi open rahega and ab toh robotics bhi kaafi boom karega to ee toh kaafi badiya hai and digitalization mei ee toh rahega hi hamesha
Agar initial package dhekna hai toh fir mnc dhekle
[06/06/25, 2:55:30 PM] Sameer Batra: plus

[06/06/25, 3:29:27 PM] Aryan Garg: Well if you prioritise skills projects and hackathons which ultimately effect your package and placement,
You should choose IIT 
and about ceramic branch i don't have any idea (to be honest never heard about it 😅) and i would say choose tier 2 mech over civil ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 3:32:45 PM] Ujjwal Singh: You can also consider Ceramic Engineering — it might not be as well-known, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad choice. In fact, companies like Saint-Gobain, which is a global leader in glass and ceramics, actively recruit from this field. Their products are used everywhere — from skyscrapers to cars — so there’s real industry value.
Just because fewer people talk about ceramics doesn’t mean it lacks scope. If you understand its applications, it's actually a niche with strong potential.

1. How is IIT Mandi overall as per your experience what are pros and cons


2. Can u give a short overview of EP as a branch and what It involves in short.
[06/06/25, 4:22:57 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Pros
- We have a good tech culture with multiple hackathons (trust me on this one), and very active clubs who regularly host events and contests
- Great fests with our last year's techfest budget being 50L+, and amazing cult and sports fests as well.
- The faculty is quite helpful and supporting and some of us have even done research projects in our 1st year under them

Cons
- Honestly can't think of any, others please tell me if you have any lol ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 4:27:44 PM] Dushyant: Cons- being in north india food options are limited(also because i come from maharashtra ), extremely cold temps is an issue at some nights 
And some courses feel forced on students(ikshima) ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 4:28:28 PM] ~ Aarush Singh: There are heaters in the winter right?
[06/06/25, 4:28:43 PM] Divyansh Jindal: You are allowed one in your room, but you must get your own
[06/06/25, 4:29:40 PM] Dushyant: You are allowed but the caretaker notes down the heater as there has been incidents where students carelessly kept them on
[06/06/25, 4:30:12 PM] Dushyant: No even caretaker will give one if he has it in his office
[06/06/25, 4:30:28 PM] Dushyant: It is preferred to get your own
[06/06/25, 4:30:52 PM] ~ Aarush Singh: Otherwise how are first year hostels? How many sharing? How are bathrooms, are they clean, hot water etc
[06/06/25, 4:31:57 PM] Divyansh Jindal: Quad sharing with 2 bunk beds. Everyone gets a separate chair, cupboard, table etc. Bathrooms are good, and cleaned regularly. Hot water is usually available unless the people who bathed before you finished it lol
[06/06/25, 4:33:08 PM] Dushyant: If you get lucky (like me i hot 3 share) you might get 3 or even 2 share rooms
[06/06/25, 4:33:16 PM] Dushyant: But bunks are inevitable ‎<This message was edited>

if you aren't sure right now what you want to do then you will need a structured path which only works when you have proper guidance, which is very important in general otherwise you'll feel stuck.

Finally it's up to you to decide. All the best 💯

It gives you better opportunities, be it in terms of pursuing higher studies or getting a tech placement or even a startup. I myself left NIT Kurukshetra CSE for this, and it is worth it. But still, don’t just take my word for it, analyse your interests and see which option aligns with it better ‎<This message was edited>

VLSI in iit mandi will provide you better opportunities in comparison to others
[06/06/25, 11:05:47 PM] Arka: vlsi and cse are very different fields, dekho kisme inclination hai zyada tumhara
[06/06/25, 11:07:15 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: Bhaiya maine abhi 3 KGP ke seniors se baat Kiya unhone bola placement lgti hai bss thoda grind Krna pdta hai 1 to 3-3 internship bhi kr rhe hai Finance related company me 2nd year se hi
[06/06/25, 11:08:36 PM] ~ 😃: Bhai kya cse valo ki jobs kam nhi hoye gi due to Ai?
[06/06/25, 11:08:55 PM] ~ 😃: Ai is upgrading very fastly
[06/06/25, 11:09:10 PM] Krish Bhagat: Agle kuch saal me pata lag jayega
[06/06/25, 11:09:31 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: Mujhe nhi lgta agr thoda mehnat kiya jaaye to placement & internship me dikkat hogi 
Unhone bola Mostly companies bhi open rhti hai saare branch ke liye
[06/06/25, 11:10:22 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Bhaiya Kya non tech internship melti Hai Kya ?
[06/06/25, 11:10:41 PM] ~ Nihal.25: I mean mech,Chem, electrical,etc.
[06/06/25, 11:10:49 PM] Dushyant: Grind dono jagah karna hoga kyuki uske alawa nahi lagne wali 
Thing is companies validity mangti hai ki tumne kya kiya unless you can show them you will do it
[06/06/25, 11:12:10 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: Agr project work internship kari hogi pehle se to wo help nhi kregi kya placement me ?
[06/06/25, 11:12:22 PM] Dushyant: Mehnat toh hai 
No matter your branch tumhe mehnat toh karni hogi to get a good tech job atleast in cs
[06/06/25, 11:12:56 PM] ~ Moulik?: Anybody give ur views- goa/jammu cse or mn vlsi
[06/06/25, 11:13:48 PM] Dushyant: Yar ye toh cse wale bhi karenge companies tumhe kyu chose karegi fir !
Think abt it jo tum karoge wohi cse wale bhi karenge so you have to work smartly in this field
[06/06/25, 11:14:16 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: Bhaiya major difference kya hai BS aur B tech me ?
[06/06/25, 11:14:44 PM] Dushyant: Bs mostly research oriented bachlors hai if i am correct
[06/06/25, 11:14:54 PM] ~ 919429580971: mandi ke grp me mandi bolenge 
jammu/goa ke grp me wo college
[06/06/25, 11:14:58 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: Ye baate to saare core branch ke liye applicable hogi na jo tech me Jana chahte hai
[06/06/25, 11:15:08 PM] Dushyant: Yup
[06/06/25, 11:15:24 PM] Dushyant: Placements are tricky part
[06/06/25, 11:15:40 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Don't take goa cse can take Mandi vlsi or jammu cse
[06/06/25, 11:15:40 PM] Dushyant: Kyuki tum jaise all india kahi log honge
[06/06/25, 11:15:44 PM] ~ Nihal.25: ?
[06/06/25, 11:15:49 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: Haa maximum higher studies prefer krte hai

[06/06/25, 11:16:03 PM] ~ Moulik?: Kuch points to support ur claim
[06/06/25, 11:16:44 PM] Dushyant: Depends agar tumhara portfolio mostly tech interns and projects se bhara hai toh companies reject nhi karni chahiye
[06/06/25, 11:16:45 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: To phir kyu na college prefer kiya jaaye development ke liye ?
[06/06/25, 11:18:00 PM] Dushyant: Sirf college se development nhi hota 
College is sort of a machinery jo bht parts se bani so you have to chose a good branch jo tumhe jo karna hai woh karne me flexible ho
[06/06/25, 11:18:27 PM] Ujjwal Singh: Goa IIT is very new it does not even have it's own campus so you don't know much about it as well what is it's culture or what and like what all it has to offer other than it's cse but that alone doesn't define your choice
[06/06/25, 11:18:53 PM] Dushyant: So the balance is must
[06/06/25, 11:19:00 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: And like mujhe UPSC krni hai to usme BS ki subjects hai jo ki help kregi mujhe but Btech me jo branch mil rhi hai jaise ceramic/chemical/petroleum ye sab usme nhi hai
[06/06/25, 11:20:33 PM] Dushyant: UPSC is a completely different beast usme bht kuch ata hai 
Its very vast of a comparison to bias out for btech and bs
[06/06/25, 11:20:36 PM] Harshit Jain: Are you sure you want to go ahead with btech subjects in upsc?
I would not suggest that you choose your branch based on availabilities for optional subject in upsc
[06/06/25, 11:24:00 PM] ~ Sunny Raj: Okk thanku bhaiya 🙏😊 for explaining all these things. 
Aage Dekhta hu ky lena hai

[06/06/25, 11:50:56 PM] Aryan Garg: Our sleep schedule depends on what time of the sem is going on
[06/06/25, 11:51:16 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Konse Sem most hectic hota hai

[07/06/25, 2:40:11 AM] Sachit Bansal: ahan not here buddy. apne mandi ke group pe puchhle
[07/06/25, 3:02:03 AM] Saksham setia: Hey everyone, quick update!

To make things easier and reduce repetitive questions during counselling, I with some inputs from sachit bhai, worked on a small Telegram bot that can answer most common JOSAA-related queries.

You can check it out here:  
👉 t.me/iitmandibot

Just a few things to note:  
* The data is mostly from our end, so it’s best for IIT Mandi–related queries. Info on other colleges might not be fully accurate.  
* It’s AI-based, so there could be small errors in ranks or cutoffs sometimes.

Hope this helps and saves everyone from repeating the same answers over and over
[07/06/25, 3:13:57 AM] ~ Rushil: Thank you so much bhai 🙏🏻🫡
[07/06/25, 3:18:41 AM] Sachit Bansal: People the best thing about this is that all its data is purely from seniors and not some random counselling site feeding gibberish to students. we've been working on it since over 2 days. 
I am working on a web frontend and expanding the dataset behind the model

Please use this to your fullest, it is absolutely for your disposal and do report us any bugs.
All the Best

[03/06/25, 11:03:07 PM] Anish Kumar: Se everything works in flow you have reach one step every sem like maths teach in first year let's say differential equations and matrix laid the foundations for your electrical and ai stuff 

And further helps in understanding your specialisation ai robotics 

However you can start learning basics like our robotronics club launches several projects and sessions.
[03/06/25, 11:03:57 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya 1 and 2 year ke major subjects

[03/06/25, 11:06:31 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya isme placements ka kya seen hai , how much can we expect from this
[03/06/25, 11:07:14 PM] Anish Kumar: @916363670952
[03/06/25, 11:08:05 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: kis ke number hai bhaiya
[03/06/25, 11:08:47 PM] Anish Kumar: Why are you so confused ?? 

What other options are you having like what are you getting in other iits as past two three years cutoff
[03/06/25, 11:09:39 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya in other iits mostly i get chemical , civil , ceramic , mechanical etc
[03/06/25, 11:09:53 PM] Anish Kumar: Which iits
[03/06/25, 11:09:59 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: but i want to pursue my carrier in ai and robotics
[03/06/25, 11:10:04 PM] Anish Kumar: Mostly gen 2 I guess
[03/06/25, 11:10:25 PM] Anish Kumar: Then I must say best option is general engineering
[03/06/25, 11:10:40 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: iit jodhpur , patna , goa , tirupati , palakkad , ropar , etc
[03/06/25, 11:10:40 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Toh fir confusion kis baat ki hai
General engineering lelo
[03/06/25, 11:10:56 PM] Anish Kumar: They are gen 2 and gen 3 only
[03/06/25, 11:11:17 PM] Vidhi Chandak: And Jab General Engineering me Robotics AI ki specialisation hai which is your specific interest then phir kya dikkat
[03/06/25, 11:11:56 PM] Anish Kumar: You are getting this chance as we are the first among all iits including gen 1 to have this specialisation in btech
[03/06/25, 11:12:01 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya isme 2 year ke baad cgpi ka to koi chakkar nhi hai na ki cgpi high honi chaiye for robotics and ai ke liye
[03/06/25, 11:12:54 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ha bhaiya ye to hai
[03/06/25, 11:13:21 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Nhi abhi tak toh nhi hai
[03/06/25, 11:13:21 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: new branch hai na isliye
[03/06/25, 11:13:46 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok . aap abhi konsi year me ho
[03/06/25, 11:14:13 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Second year
[03/06/25, 11:14:30 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: okk then how is your experience
[03/06/25, 11:14:39 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: is it worth it
[03/06/25, 11:14:56 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Totally worth it man
[03/06/25, 11:15:04 PM] Anish Kumar: Nhi hoga main agenda of the branch ki tum apna interest pursue karo like hamari branch mein 28 log hain and there is no caps koi bhi koi si specialisation le skta hain and you will find same in your batch ki sab robo ai nhi lenge some will move onto finance and mechatronics and communication and open 

And as ye btech nhi hain iit mandi ke ander toh students bhi limited honge so they can intake  around 50-70 ig and whole branch size is just 30 
So koi criteria nhi haib
[03/06/25, 11:15:53 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya ek doubt or hai ki iit mandi specialistion in ai and robotics me or other iits ke ai me frak kya hai
[03/06/25, 11:16:24 PM] Anish Kumar: You will explore robotics perspects in fields of ai
[03/06/25, 11:16:58 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Jaha tak mere ko pta hai baaki iits mei ai and ds mei BTech hoti hai aur yaha ai and robotics mei hai
[03/06/25, 11:17:27 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Aur yeh baat toh hai hi
[03/06/25, 11:17:33 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: bhaiya lekin ye itne piche rank tak kyu milti hai
[03/06/25, 11:18:12 PM] Vidhi Chandak: bcz new branch hai , Jyada popular nahi h for now and ye specialisations bahut recently add huwe hai isliye .
[03/06/25, 11:19:43 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Kyunki pichle saal tak koi clear course structure nhi tha par ab saara curriculum for all specializations bn gya hai
[03/06/25, 11:20:15 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok than can i get this with 4282 rank obc ncl
[03/06/25, 11:20:24 PM] Anish Kumar: Because people were in 2nd year and they designed their curriculum
[03/06/25, 11:20:31 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: pichle saal 4693 tha cutoff
[03/06/25, 11:20:55 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Iska koi idea nhi hai kyunki iss saal cutoff uper jaane ke poore chances hai
[03/06/25, 11:21:11 PM] Anish Kumar: We have opening rank of 7000 general category and closing somewhere around 10800
[03/06/25, 11:21:35 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok
[03/06/25, 11:21:51 PM] Anish Kumar: That ig is not bad
[03/06/25, 11:22:24 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ig ??
[03/06/25, 11:22:29 PM] Anish Kumar: I guess
[03/06/25, 11:23:50 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: so can i get this branch
[03/06/25, 11:23:57 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: any possibility
[03/06/25, 11:24:12 PM] Vidhi Chandak: Mock round me pata chal jayega
[03/06/25, 11:24:24 PM] Sachit Bansal: Yea
[03/06/25, 11:24:45 PM] ~ MANEK YADAV: ok
[03/06/25, 11:38:38 PM] Akshat Jha: guys @A is me, Akshat Jha, Robotics and AI 3rd year, 


wrt placements since we didnt have our own internship drive yet,  all i can say is it honestly depends on the company as Piyush Roy told, ie, a strong communicator needs to be there in general engineering (ek toh hoga hi (in 30ppl) toh chinta mat karo) who can convince the hiring team of companies to let our branch sit for that (uske aage depends on ur skills to crack the company based on its hiring procedure)

[04/06/25, 1:53:43 PM] Sachit Bansal: @916260553385 @916363670952
[04/06/25, 1:54:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: Other branches ke to bohot advantage mein rahoge
[04/06/25, 1:54:31 PM] Sachit Bansal: And considerably other iits ke bhi
[04/06/25, 1:54:43 PM] Sachit Bansal: Because kisi iit mein particularly btech mein quant nahi padhare hain
[04/06/25, 1:54:51 PM] Sachit Bansal: To subject knowledge strong hogi tumhari bohot
[04/06/25, 1:54:52 PM] Vitthal Seth: Specific companies ka nahi keh skte but ofc agr tumhare domain ke liye companies attract kr paye toh obv priority bhi tumhe hi milegi , kyuki koi bhi btech branch iske aas paas ka bhi kuch cover ni krti
[04/06/25, 1:56:42 PM] Sachit Bansal: And mostly its not about company visintinf the campus. Tum 4 saal campus mein hoge so you build connections accross this domain with peers seniors and proffs to network bhi waisa build hoke tum companies ko khud se bhi approach kr paoge. Proffs ke bhi tons of references hote hain to help out
[04/06/25, 1:57:18 PM] Sachit Bansal: Point is ki at the end of the day agar subject knowledge achhi hai to company coming to campus or not coming with not be a significant problem
[04/06/25, 1:57:22 PM] ~ Avi: Haa understandable. But should I prefer this over bits msc chem/phy. Cuz waha bhi finance minor ka option hota hai second year se and I'm sure these companies come over there, I talked to a senior over there.
[04/06/25, 1:58:03 PM] ~ Avi: I see
[04/06/25, 1:58:10 PM] Sachit Bansal: Udhar tum minor karoge. Idhar specialisation with IIT Tag
[04/06/25, 1:59:10 PM] Sachit Bansal: And then bits vs iit mein again whole another debate of culture opportunities inter iit networking and stuff aa jata
[04/06/25, 1:59:29 PM] ~ Avi: Haan baat toh sahi hai. But bits ka alumni network is more vast and established than IIT mandi right. So tabhi mai soch raha tha
[04/06/25, 1:59:49 PM] Sachit Bansal: Hn that is one point with bits cant deny
[04/06/25, 2:00:17 PM] Sachit Bansal: You see its not iit mandi network
[04/06/25, 2:00:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Its IIT network
[04/06/25, 2:00:48 PM] Sachit Bansal: So bits network cant be stronger than iit network i believe
[04/06/25, 2:00:57 PM] Sachit Bansal: And you wont be limited to iit mandi ever
[04/06/25, 2:01:13 PM] Sachit Bansal: I have friends in roorkee delhi kgp ropar
[04/06/25, 2:01:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: Through their reference i have access to their alumni and proffs
[04/06/25, 2:01:33 PM] Sachit Bansal: Common connect ki baat hoti hai
[04/06/25, 2:05:34 PM] ~ Avi: Haan woh toh hai, iit sunte he respect ++. I talked to one bits waale bhaiya and he was laughing like mandi kaun jata hai bits chorke. Bits ke seniors are very biased bout their college ngl. Aur thora sochna parega iske baare mei. Cuz I want the IIT tag but since it's a new course so thora dicey hai mamla.
[04/06/25, 2:05:59 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bro understand one thing
[04/06/25, 2:06:14 PM] Sachit Bansal: Tumhe iit ka real tag 10 years baad kaam aayega
[04/06/25, 2:06:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Tab tak mandi will be far better
[04/06/25, 2:06:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: And to be very honest
[04/06/25, 2:06:47 PM] Sachit Bansal: Last 2 years mein bohot grow hua hai mandi. Uska tech cultre and student body has massively progressed
[04/06/25, 2:07:16 PM] Sachit Bansal: Ye effect 4th year tak propogate hone mein 2 saal hain. Uske baad india ko dikhega. But we know internally kitne opportunities nikalre hain
[04/06/25, 2:07:37 PM] Sachit Bansal: Plus as far as tumhe opps milre and growth hori hai and complimentrt iit tag hai
[04/06/25, 2:07:40 PM] Sachit Bansal: Kya dikkat hai
[04/06/25, 2:07:58 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bete chhuttiyon mein school jaake teachers se milna iit ki tshir pehnke
[04/06/25, 2:08:13 PM] Sachit Bansal: 10-11th ke bacccheee puchhte hain “bhaiya kaise crack kara”
[04/06/25, 2:08:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bits ke liue ni puchhenge
[04/06/25, 2:08:24 PM] Sachit Bansal: Goal sabka iit hota hai
[04/06/25, 2:08:26 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bits nahi
[04/06/25, 2:08:36 PM] Sachit Bansal: Iit na milne pe bits ko achha bolke udhar jaate hain log
[04/06/25, 2:11:31 PM] ~ Avi: Haan yeh toh sach bol diya aapne. Haan like I agree prep start Kari thi 11th mei with the mindset ki IIT mei jaana hai. Ab agar bits chala jau toh ek cheez reh jayegi. Emotional point of view se toh IIT mandi he clear winner hai. Logically bhi yahi sahi decision lag raha hai.

[04/06/25, 2:39:32 PM] ~ Avi: That's why I was preferring bits in this scenario, cuz I've heard there's this thing called practice school. So jpmc and some other finance firms come there. Aur mostly cgpa and fin minor ke basis pe bacche uthate he for internships. waha se so it's a simpler route I beleive. What's ur opinion on this
[04/06/25, 2:40:38 PM] Piyush Roy: Tumhe bits meh kaunsi branch mil rahi hai?
[04/06/25, 2:41:26 PM] ~ Avi: 272 aya hai, so borderline of circuital. Msc is sureshot.
[04/06/25, 2:43:20 PM] Piyush Roy: See badi firms pehle high college then high branches and then high iq walo ko prefer karte hai 


Soo it's on you to decide ki tum bits meh stand kar paoge ya nahi
[04/06/25, 2:44:13 PM] Piyush Roy: And secondly the fee at bits is also too high. Tho baad meh voh cheez worth it rahegi ya nahi yeh bhi soachna
[04/06/25, 2:47:53 PM] Sachit Bansal: Plus
[04/06/25, 2:49:24 PM] ~ Avi: Haan I see, Itna effort diya nahi tha jee pe honestly. Ab toh college pe jaake he I'll know where do I stand. But I just wanna make sure I'm not taking the wrong decision taaki baad mei Jake regrets na ho

[04/06/25, 3:18:45 PM] Piyush Roy: Coz culture acha hai waha par 

Finance/ quant/ counsultancy meh order of college essa hai 

Tier 1 iit > Bits Pilani campus > tier 2 iit and bits other campus> 0 in other Colleges
[04/06/25, 3:21:24 PM] Piyush Roy: Tbvh, agar fees issue nahi hai and bits meh tumhe non circuital seh satisfied ho tho go with bits 👍🏻
[04/06/25, 3:22:33 PM] ~ Tahir: Dual degree is msc
[04/06/25, 3:22:38 PM] ~ Avi: Msc mean masters in basic sciences like phy, chem etc. Fir at the end of second year we get our desired branch on the basis of cgpa. 8+ for cs and 7+ for circuital and so on
[04/06/25, 3:22:54 PM] ~ Tahir: 4 yrs btech + 1 yr u get masters

[05/06/25, 12:10:33 PM] Piyush Roy: Actually if you pay at IIT Mandi then aapko degree sirf IIT Mandi ki milti hai usmeh likha rahega ki Btech in general engineering with specialization in abc from Dalarna university 

But agar tumhe Dalarna ka bhi certification chahiye tho waha ki fee bharni hogi
[05/06/25, 12:11:45 PM] Sachit Bansal: First 2 years mein sem 4 is little heavy. Rest is chill
[05/06/25, 12:12:02 PM] Sachit Bansal: Because then uske baad sab kuchh nahi padhna hai
[05/06/25, 12:13:15 PM] ~ Abhinav Sharma: toh agar koi jaye udhar padhne par degree mandi ki hi le toh fees mandi ki hi lagegi dalarna ki nahi

[05/06/25, 12:26:49 PM] Vidhi Chandak: First of all , Jab kisi company ke interview me jaate ho toh they don't expect you to know everything about the field , Ofc training period hota hai and usme aapko sikhaya jata hai about the post you will be getting 

secondly if you are clr about what u want to do or what specific post you want in a company , Then i think 2 yrs will be sufficient and ofc Cllg courses doesn't matter that much , Your own side by side efforts will matter the most

[05/06/25, 12:42:11 PM] Sachit Bansal: Ek junior ko chahiye bhaiya
[05/06/25, 12:42:21 PM] Sachit Bansal: Kaise milti hai😂
[05/06/25, 12:42:26 PM] Akshat Jha: as in question kya hai?
[05/06/25, 12:42:30 PM] Akshat Jha: acha
[05/06/25, 12:42:47 PM] Sachit Bansal: He was just askiing ki kismein kari hain and kaise kaise stuff hoga
[05/06/25, 12:50:51 PM] Akshat Jha: acha
[05/06/25, 12:52:14 PM] Akshat Jha: in one line : at startups (sometimes fun sometimes hectic sometimes crushing) itself on domains of backend, voice ai, and enhancing rag pipelines
[05/06/25, 1:04:01 PM] ~ Vansh Gupta: Bhaiya meri 12k rank hai toh kya ge mil sakti hai kya....
[05/06/25, 1:04:57 PM] Vitthal Seth: Kaafi mushkil hai ngl, closing ranks uper hi jaenge branch ke , pichhle saal hi 10.8k pe close hui thi
[05/06/25, 1:05:43 PM] ~ Vansh Gupta: Mujhe bhi wahi laga but 2023 me 12k gayi thi toh i guess ho bhi sakta hai
[05/06/25, 1:06:35 PM] Vitthal Seth: Hmm dekho daal do , miracles hote hain pr humlog bhi jo observe krre hain closing bhi uper hi jaegi , toh ek realistic fall back option explore kro , GE milna mushkil hai! ‎<This message was edited>
[05/06/25, 1:08:36 PM] ~ Abhinav Sharma: prof kaise h gen engg ke
[05/06/25, 1:14:55 PM] ~ Vansh Gupta: Toh bhaiya backup ke liye iit bhu ceramic engineering sahi rahega ya iit patna engineering in physics ya phir koi aur option aapke hisab se btw rank-12k (gen male)
[05/06/25, 1:17:58 PM] Sachit Bansal: Bhai considering ki branch aage jaake devide hogi to koi particular proff hai ni GE ke
[05/06/25, 1:18:09 PM] Sachit Bansal: But in general mostly proff mandi ke achhe hain supporting hai
[05/06/25, 1:18:17 PM] Sachit Bansal: Baaki padhai ke maamle mein idk
[05/06/25, 1:18:59 PM] Vitthal Seth: See bhot slim possibility hai GE milne ki so assume you are not getting it (mtlb order mei uper daal dena pr maan ke chalo nahi hi mil rhi hai), phir apna naya ek safe , sure shot option dekho , kyuki mp wahi milega , zyada cutoffs change nahi honge iss saal bhi opening closing ke , toh GE ko bas rkh uper priority mei mil gya toh miracle , wrna jo sure shot tha woh toh mil hi jaye
[05/06/25, 1:19:25 PM] ~ Abhinav Sharma: aap gen engg main nahi h kya
[05/06/25, 1:19:34 PM] Sachit Bansal: Hun bhai
[05/06/25, 1:19:45 PM] Sachit Bansal: Lekin padhai mein nahi hun😂
[05/06/25, 1:19:50 PM] Vitthal Seth: hein pr acad ni krte bhaiyaa😂
[05/06/25, 1:19:59 PM] ~ Vansh Gupta: Toh bhaiya aap hi kuch suggest kar do
[05/06/25, 1:20:12 PM] ~ Vansh Gupta: Like in dono me se konsa sahi rahega
[05/06/25, 1:21:40 PM] Vitthal Seth: @919049536185 acad ke baare mei acche se bata paenge , although this is true kaafi bhadiya proffs hain , i have met a alumni who had friends like relation with satvasheel sir , so yeah and iit mei acad toh accha hota hi hai uski tension na le
[05/06/25, 1:22:02 PM] Sachit Bansal: Use kya batara hai satvasheel
[05/06/25, 1:22:09 PM] Sachit Bansal: Use thodi pata hoga kon hI
[05/06/25, 1:23:35 PM] Piyush Roy: GE ka luck acha hai, GE keh prof tbh bahut ache rahe abhi tak 
Baaki keh baare meh nahi bolunga
[05/06/25, 1:23:44 PM] Vitthal Seth: dekho wahi baat hai thoda ceramic engg ka dekho online , agr tu course jhel lega (hate ni krra ) , toh bhu lelo , although placements ka core mei koi khas ummed mat rkh , lekin agr fall back accha rkhna hai , side ki cheezein itte bhadiya nahi bhi hui toh engg phy patna se core mei kuchh toh mil hi jaega
[05/06/25, 1:24:41 PM] ~ Abhinav Sharma: sahi baat h
[05/06/25, 1:25:00 PM] Sachit Bansal: 😂
[05/06/25, 1:25:01 PM] Vitthal Seth: main couselling grp pr bhi puchh le , aur opinions lene ho toh , idhr gen engg ke related puchho sirf

[05/06/25, 1:27:12 PM] Sachit Bansal: Terko jo branch hai usi mein placement chahiye?
[05/06/25, 1:27:15 PM] Sachit Bansal: Ya apne interest se
[05/06/25, 1:27:54 PM] ~ Vansh Gupta: Mainly job branch ho kyuki abhi tak koi interest nahi hai as such kisi bhi branch me after college pata nhi kya sochunga
[05/06/25, 1:27:59 PM] Vitthal Seth: again mse ke doubts counselling grp pe puchh le zyada acche response milenge

[06/06/25, 1:21:38 AM] ~ Arpit: Bhaiya i want to know like What do u think about how much SDE related role(tech) companies/ finance companies will allow GE graduate to sit for placements?( Out of 10 companies let say) and will it be  comparable/ higher/lower to mech engineering people? ( As i'm also getting mandi mechanical)
[06/06/25, 1:22:06 AM] ~ GAURAV SINGH: ha bhaiya usme core oppo kam lg rhi thi
[06/06/25, 1:22:10 AM] Sachit Bansal: mech se zyada preference milegi due to robo ai
[06/06/25, 1:22:43 AM] Sachit Bansal: again. branch pe dependent nahi hai vo. bhai tu partial dropper hai terko real mein pata hona chahiye ye sab

[06/06/25, 1:24:20 AM] Vitthal Seth: You always can , if you have more domain knowledge than any other , no discrimination on the basis of branch!
[06/06/25, 1:24:36 AM] Vitthal Seth: That is for sure!
[06/06/25, 1:25:08 AM] ~ GAURAV SINGH: ha sir
[06/06/25, 1:27:53 AM] Vidhi Chandak: Vaise Most of the companies allow all the students to sit in placements and uske baad what matters is your skillset .
Toh you will see it very less in iits ki only some specific branch ke students are allowed to sit for specific roles .
[06/06/25, 1:28:25 AM] ~ GAURAV SINGH: didiii jodhpur me chem 11200 tk tha meri 11900 h uske neeche sab h civil etc milra

[06/06/25, 1:41:51 AM] Piyush Roy: Emotional mat hua karo answer karte hue
See company par depend karega ki voh allow kare ya na kare, hamare liye kare and fir next time tumhare batch keh liye na kare 
Saari cheezen company policy hai.
We try ki karde but at the end its on company. 

DONT EXPECT THAT software companies BAITHNE HI DENGI, its tough and accept

But apart from software there are companies jo tumhe equivalent placement de and tum waha career bana sako. Hamare yaha robotics ki companies aati hai jo HDFC, Samsung, startups, infact amazon seh bhi jyada stipend deti hai soo usmeh career banao.

[06/06/25, 12:02:13 PM] Sachit Bansal: Brochure and FAQ in decryption

[06/06/25, 12:03:22 PM] ~ Sahil Choudhary: According to brochure it looks good
[06/06/25, 12:04:01 PM] ~ Sahil Choudhary: But if you are in this then how is this branch, how can the placement wage be, what is its scene
[06/06/25, 12:05:41 PM] ~ Jatin: What companies came there for internship, and what is the intern stats for this branch ?How much is workload ? And can we get enough time for sd preparation side by side?
[06/06/25, 12:27:39 PM] Piyush Roy: When we are saying to read the FAQ then read it at least.
[06/06/25, 12:28:51 PM] Piyush Roy: Placement opportunities bhi achi hai, you can go for robotics, finance, data stats, mech, ev, electrical( if allowed by companies )

[06/06/25, 1:26:04 PM] Ritvik Garg: Yes, if the courses which are part of your specialisation are CSE courses, then you will be taught by the same professors as CSE people
[06/06/25, 1:28:03 PM] Ritvik Garg: I am not sure whether major + minor degree exists here....what I am sure about is that every branch allows you to take elective courses in the 3rd and 4th years
These elective courses are generally interdisciplinary, meaning you can study in courses from other branches as well
[06/06/25, 1:30:00 PM] ~ student'25: If I do open specialisation in something, it won't be considered as minor, right?  Also can I choose like whole course duplicate of cse students in third and fourth year  in my open specialisation curriculum, is there any restrictions?
[06/06/25, 1:31:40 PM] Ritvik Garg: No no, that is not a minor degree...if you read the brochure carefully, it says that the degree awarded will be "btech in general engineering" instead of "btech in general engineering with specialization in ABC"
However, since this is a new branch, we can consider the option of converting open specialisation to a minor degree 
But for now, there is no provision for minor degree
[06/06/25, 1:32:15 PM] Ritvik Garg: No, you can't duplicate the entire course of CSE
There are restrictions, like you can't choose all your electives as only CSE courses
[06/06/25, 1:34:34 PM] ~ student'25: Can you clarify it more, how many electives we can choose, what are the restrictions..... I don't understand this part
[06/06/25, 1:52:17 PM] Ritvik Garg: The restriction is that "the combination of the elective courses is less than 40% of the discipline core courses of a specific branch"
I'll explain with an example....so suppose CSE students have 3 core courses A, B, C 
40% of 3 is 1.2...this means that you only get to choose 1 core course of CSE
Moreover, you can't just choose any one out of A, B or C....it may be that the professor taking course C doesn't allow you to sit in that course (maybe because you haven't done some prerequisites for that course), so you can't choose course C ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 1:54:50 PM] Ritvik Garg: In open specialisation, you get to do elective courses of 52 credits 
I don't know if you'll get what that means, but the takeaway point for you is youll get to study more elective courses in open specialisation than other specialisations ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 1:56:53 PM] ~ student'25: Are there any core courses that you must have to take in third or fourth year in general engineering
[06/06/25, 1:58:06 PM] Ritvik Garg: Yes...I think 1-2 are common irrespective of your specialisation and then you obviously have core courses relevant to your specialisation 
@916260553385 bhaiya can answer this one better, hes in third year ‎<This message was edited>

I m also considering mandi civil as well but since ge is new branch but has better cutoff , i m confused which one should be good for me.. pls help should I keep ge over civil? Because civil i will get most probably
[06/06/25, 2:44:58 PM] ~ Arpit Agarwal: And is the reason for better cutoff for this branch because of specialization it allows in robotics and ai?

[06/06/25, 5:06:01 PM] ~ Saashi Gupta: Hello seniors. I talked to @919057566718 regd GE and I came to know its a great branch. Could anyone shine light on the loopholes or cons of this branch, if any?
[06/06/25, 5:06:34 PM] ~ Saashi Gupta: pls understand we r trying to take heavy decisions here.

[06/06/25, 5:07:19 PM] ~ Saashi Gupta: for context, i have a 17k rank in female and my other options r mostly mechanical in tier 2
[06/06/25, 5:07:26 PM] Vitthal Seth: since it is VERY unique, the courses might feel heavy in 3rd and 4th year so might find hectic , but assuming you choose the specialisation that YOU like , it may be rather smooth ! ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 5:07:59 PM] ~ Saashi Gupta: I see.
[06/06/25, 5:08:40 PM] ~ Saashi Gupta: If I am right, one has to be a rather decisive person to be in this branch and be clear about what they want, either early on or after 1st year?
[06/06/25, 5:09:34 PM] Vitthal Seth: Because courses are not traditional Btech courses , some might even be where you sit with Mtech and Phd guys but again not THAT tough!
[06/06/25, 5:09:37 PM] Vitthal Seth: No you can decide till the end of 2nd year
[06/06/25, 5:10:14 PM] Vitthal Seth: Only few have decided anything, most of us are still exploring!
[06/06/25, 5:10:20 PM] ~ Saashi Gupta: Right. and why are you saying the courses will feel heavy in 2nd year? are you saying in comparison to some other branch??
[06/06/25, 5:13:31 PM] Vitthal Seth: .
[06/06/25, 5:14:47 PM] Vitthal Seth: 3rd sem is rather chill (VERY) , whereas 4th sem is heavy in comparison to CSE or DSE , but we are working on it ! But mostly one can handle it !
[06/06/25, 5:15:31 PM] ~ Dr Sonia Singh Baweja: Maam /sir what r the future prospects ‎<This message was edited>
[06/06/25, 5:16:12 PM] Vitthal Seth: Yeah i mean , cg would be calculated branch wise after 1st year so , in some branches it is easier to score CG mostly due to marking schemes and courses (like some may use relative or absolute grading etc)
[06/06/25, 5:16:32 PM] ~ Nihal.25: I also have same doubts about placements bcz its new but concept mast Hai esliye
[06/06/25, 5:16:36 PM] Vitthal Seth: For every specialisation, this is listed in the brochure
[06/06/25, 5:17:26 PM] ~ Nihal.25: But Baki specialisation except aerospace non-IITs se Hai to Kya thek rahega unko Karna?
[06/06/25, 5:18:00 PM] Vitthal Seth: Yeah so we don’t have the figures in yet , because our branch is new, however our seniors will sit for internships this year , then the picture would be crystal clear, so yeah hope for the best
[06/06/25, 5:18:44 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Toh unka results kab aayega?
[06/06/25, 5:19:00 PM] ~ Nihal.25: So that I can adjust my choice filling
[06/06/25, 5:19:01 PM] Vitthal Seth: No , youve got something wrong , i think wrong brochure, new and updated brochure is in description!
[06/06/25, 5:20:02 PM] Vitthal Seth: There are no figures or data i can show you , because everything atp would be speculative, but we are expecting really strong results!

[06/06/25, 5:33:49 PM] Anish Kumar: Sweden mein only they will cover your teaching expenses 

Rest cost of living you will need to invest 
 
Apart from that if you want degree of Sweden university of what courses you did there you have to pay some amount

[06/06/25, 5:42:59 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Milegi?
[06/06/25, 5:43:08 PM] Vitthal Seth: Minimising the adjustment period from college kid to a full time employee ready for the industry
[06/06/25, 5:43:34 PM] Vitthal Seth: Haaaan that all internship time would be counted , since they will teach you there ways there!

[06/06/25, 5:45:32 PM] ~ Nihal.25: But as intern Mai thodi fir specialisation karunga esliye
[06/06/25, 5:45:51 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ya fir dono sath Mai hota Hai?
[06/06/25, 5:46:06 PM] Vitthal Seth: Whi naa as a intern seekhogee !
[06/06/25, 5:47:21 PM] Piyush Roy: Kehna yeh chah rahe hai ki for eg tum specialisation karte tho bentley keh sath, voh mainly industrial automation par kaam karti hai tho essa kuch likha ayega 

Btech in GE with specialisation in industrial automation with Bentley
[06/06/25, 5:48:06 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ok understood 
Thank you Bhaiya
[06/06/25, 5:57:30 PM] ~ sinha: How is the overall experience with specialisation in general engineering?
[06/06/25, 5:58:34 PM] ~ Jayy: ‎~ Jayy joined from the community
[06/06/25, 5:59:34 PM] Vitthal Seth: Fairly good , we all very optimistic abt the branch ,(since seniors and us designed it)
[06/06/25, 6:00:00 PM] Vitthal Seth: Do you have any doubts? That is a very general ques to ask tbh!
[06/06/25, 6:00:20 PM] Vitthal Seth: Specialisations will start this coming sem
[06/06/25, 6:00:37 PM] Vitthal Seth: For our seniors , so no first hand experience
[06/06/25, 6:00:40 PM] ~ sinha: Like how many specialisations are confirmed till now?
[06/06/25, 6:00:56 PM] Vitthal Seth: B R O U C H U R E

[06/06/25, 6:02:19 PM] Vitthal Seth: Yeah so 5 ARE! (We made the brochure ourselves bro)
[06/06/25, 6:02:42 PM] Vitthal Seth: And some may be inducted in the future if substantial interest is shown
[06/06/25, 6:03:51 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Okay bhai
[06/06/25, 6:05:45 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Bhaiya i have no particular instrust

[06/06/25, 6:06:05 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: I am really confused between
[06/06/25, 6:06:28 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: BS kanpur earth science/ BS chemistry or general eng at mandi
[06/06/25, 6:06:40 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Apne brochure bhi pdha
[06/06/25, 6:06:45 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Jayada kuch idea lga nhi
[06/06/25, 6:07:04 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Kanpur isliye becz usme thoda bhot branch change ka bhi chance
[06/06/25, 6:07:05 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Hai
[06/06/25, 6:07:17 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: But seniors said dnt join because of branch change
[06/06/25, 6:07:51 PM] Vitthal Seth: See one is FULL research and you might do Masters and higher studies to make it worth it , other is making you industry ready , some of the most innovative courses and specialisations
[06/06/25, 6:08:03 PM] Vitthal Seth: Exactly!
[06/06/25, 6:08:37 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Because in kanpur you'll get a lot of competition for branch change
[06/06/25, 6:08:41 PM] Vitthal Seth: Batao na , rough picture mili?
[06/06/25, 6:08:48 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Ek iit delhi biotech wale senior se baat kri kehta agar iit hi ana h aur lowest branch mil rhi h to top 5 me hi ana
[06/06/25, 6:09:11 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Exactly bhaiya
[06/06/25, 6:09:34 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Lekin agar gate or cat bhi further ka plan hua to kanpur shi h
[06/06/25, 6:09:34 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: ?
[06/06/25, 6:10:02 PM] Vitthal Seth: Haaan pr lower does not promise you anything , most of the things the dependent of your calibre , how much you can do on the side
[06/06/25, 6:10:08 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Yeh tumhare upar hai ab  hmmare pass bhi yeh option thi but we made our choice ourselves.
[06/06/25, 6:10:46 PM] Vitthal Seth: Haaaan mostly if you want higher studies , kanpur research is quite useful !
[06/06/25, 6:11:30 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: And u are happy
[06/06/25, 6:11:36 PM] Vitthal Seth: Try to make contact with seniors of these lower branches in top5’s then you will get a clearer picture
[06/06/25, 6:11:36 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: After that bhaiya
[06/06/25, 6:11:38 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: ?
[06/06/25, 6:11:49 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: I have made
[06/06/25, 6:12:06 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: But there are very less seniors i am finding in this branch
[06/06/25, 6:12:10 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: On linkedin insta
[06/06/25, 6:12:13 PM] ~ Abhinav Tripathi: Etc
[06/06/25, 6:13:20 PM] Vitthal Seth: Bhayy people are kaafi optimistic abt the branch , kyuki all the specialisations are industry specifics and one of their kind ! ROBO AI as a degree is NOT offered in ANY IIT , so clear advantage
[06/06/25, 6:13:33 PM] Vitthal Seth: For companies like schrodinger and seimens

[06/06/25, 6:18:06 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Bhaiya would there be any CPI criteria for specialisation
[06/06/25, 6:18:20 PM] Vitthal Seth: You mean CGPA?
[06/06/25, 6:18:28 PM] ~ Nihal.25: Ha
[06/06/25, 6:18:58 PM] Somanshu Juneja: Naah till now there is no cap on the number of students that can take a particular specialisation
[06/06/25, 6:19:10 PM] Vitthal Seth: No cap, for choosing a specialisation there is no requirement of CGPA or anything
[06/06/25, 6:19:17 PM] Vitthal Seth: It is free to choose for all

[06/06/25, 8:30:37 PM] ~ 😃: In general engineering placement does people get job of general engineering or they learn coding side by side and get job in software company? Like people in IIT mandi biochemical branch learn coding and get placement is this same with general engineering or not ?
[06/06/25, 8:35:05 PM] Ritvik Garg: That depends on you....I mean if you have taken Fintech specialisation suppose, and then you're also prepping your software skills for a software job, then it's possible you can land a job in either domain
But if this was your motive, why did you join general engineering in the first place? See this branch is all about removing this rigidity which exists in the system....it removes the problem of "I'm stuck with biotech but I wanted to go in cs domain"....here, you dont have to do coding on the side when you can do coding in the main
[06/06/25, 8:43:31 PM] ~ 😃: If everybody want  to join artificial intelligence course after 2 year will they allow it to join everyone or there is any limit how many people can join in a particular branch?
[06/06/25, 8:51:26 PM] Ritvik Garg: No theres no limit, that's because everyone won't want to join AI specialisation
